  "transcript": "Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] So before we start, I have something for you. What? What's that? Oh no. [Laughter] Wow. This one is I think year 2000 when I just moved to [Laughter] [Music] Philip. 5 years ago we started with nothing. It has been an incredible journey from building the whole sales force from zero to now we have more than 700 over of them. The mission is also to build beyond stop booking to cater to the needs of uh these clients. Philip has over the years consistently broadened the scope of its uh products and services. It is really this long-term uh objective of growing with the clients and we know that their needs are beyond just investment. So we are there for our customers uh in every stages of their journey from wealth accumulation, wealth preservation as well as wealth distributions. So that is the whole idea of how Philip decided to go beyond stop working and build the various product and services and having our wealth managers to service the client throughout their life cycle and financial journey. I joined Philip in year 2000. At that point of time we are very young very new okay system is not up yet everything is actually go very manually insurer we are just on boarding only so we got roughly about six seven insurer and then we starting to bring in uh unit trust funhouse to come in so everything is very new to me there were a lot of challenges in the early days I started as a deskbound accountant to a sales role so it's already a big shift I also have to change from talking about numbers to building relationship and understanding clients. So that point of time we are all are starting to learn together with Philips and then we grow. What's important to me is that as as a team we work together, we learn together uh contribute together. What makes it even more meaningful is uh strong support from our salespeople. They take time to show up. It's about team spirit. What keep me going is the appreciation I receive from my clients. When someone tells me that they are very lucky to have me as their advisor, it really touches me. Now the conversation will be more like you know how to lead a more purposeful life uh when they have reached their financial goal. That is very um heartwarming. I'm grateful for everyone who has uh helped me along the way in this past 22 years in Philip. be it from advisers, from my team members, the core staff and even the management. Without them, I think we wouldn't be where we are today. Very grateful for them. To me, going together means to nudge each other in the right direction because especially money is concerned in this financial industry. We need to do the right things. I did reflect upon it and I go back to Philip's corporate code. When we build this well business, we only play positive some games. If there's a win lose, somebody will exit the game. So we always play positive some things that keep us going. Building a culture, a culture in a community, our advisers, our colleagues, our support teams, we work together and we are always grateful that we have like-minded people that join in this journey together with us. We have come so far for the past 50 years. So we should be always having a grateful heart for the things that happened, the clients that came along. Many more good things to come. Looking into the future, I hope Philly Capital continues to be innovative to help their advisers uh come up with market leading solutions to meet the needs of their clients. Happy birthday to Philly Capital. Wishing the company and all of us continue to be able to grow from strength to strength. You know you when you have arrived or you come 50 years, you always reflect, right? So the history is always a good guide to help us to appreciate what have brought us throughout the 50 years and moving forward the challenges are there. I find that the most important thing is whatever we do as long we center around the clients and the solution around the clients that will keep us going for the next 50 or 100 years."
