  "transcript": "In professional wrestling, when you're booking a feud, you know, for say like SummerSlam or some sort of big big wrestling event, you don't usually book heal versus heel. In other words, bad guy versus bad guy. People want to root for the good guy. They want to boo the bad guy. It's very conflicting when you have bad guy versus bad guy. And yet, if you think both of these people are clowns, who do you root for? Look at this. Elon and I had a great relationship. I don't know if we will anymore. I'm very disappointed in Elon. This is really juicy stuff, huh? I honestly don't have enough popcorn to last. I have to get I have to get more I have to get more popcorn. So, here on Truth Social, um I mean, you can just watch this whole thing unfold in real time. It's It's like the biggest breakup of the summer. Uh and the breakup that everyone knew was coming eventually. Well, we got it. The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do that. And here you can see Tesla stock in real time. Well, this is what it was when the markets closed today at 4 p.m. Down $47.35 or 14%. today, year to date, that means since January, Tesla's already down about 30%. And of course, this matters because Tesla depends on its nearly 38 billion dollar that they've received in government subsidies over the last decade to keep going. So, if you hate Elon Musk, are you rooting for Trump to cut the government subsidies and just obliterate Tesla stock? Or if you hate Trump, are you hoping that Elon, who we know probably has a lot of dirt on everybody cuz he's got all that all that private data now, maybe he says something really bad about Trump, is this is like mutual destruction. Maybe the WWE could learn something from this because I'll tell you one thing, this heel versus heel storyline that's really shaping up between Trump and Elon, it's really exciting. What's going to happen next? Well, there you"
