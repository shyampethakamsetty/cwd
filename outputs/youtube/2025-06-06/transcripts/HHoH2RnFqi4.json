  "transcript": "What's up guys? This is Ray J and today I want to talk about what's happening with Tesla stock and the broader markets. I want to talk about what's happening with Elon Musk and President Trump as Elon Musk is now saying that President Trump's tariffs are not good and they may cause a recession very soon. We're seeing the arguments, the feud continuing and this is going to be affecting the markets even more. So, I'll break everything down in this video. Just know that I am not a financial planner so take nothing I'm saying as financial advice. And also, if you guys can please check out my Mumu link.

So, as far as Tesla's going, as you guys could tell, we have a left shoulder, a head, and then a right shoulder. And we got this very, very big rejection so far causing this big downside move. Now, in the beginning, right, Tesla and the market were holding up. Okay, we were holding up in the beginning. We saw Tesla dip a little bit only to try to bounce, forming like a V-shaped move in the very beginning. Um, that was because of the fact that President Trump met up with Xi Jinping. Well, he didn't meet up with him. He just had a phone call with him. Let me correct myself there. And he said that they had a very, very good talk. There's a deal coming. Things went very well. Um Xi Jinping also invited President Trump and the first lady Melania Trump to um China to discuss a lot of different things. So things were going very well. Uh that's why we saw the market bounce a bit. But then it started to get this massive rug pull um as we started to see President Trump and Elon Musk argue and the argument got worse and worse and worse to the point where we saw Tesla crash 14%. Uh because we started to see a lot of things getting brought up involving Tesla subsidies. Um, at the same time, the market followed the trend. We saw the market sell off as well. So, I'm going to break down what's happening between these arguments and what this means for us moving forward as Tesla took a very, very big hit. Keep in mind that although we have this head and shoulders, we do have this big support right here around this 270 to 275 area. Um, we are trying to rebound in the after hours a little bit. We could try to see a small gap up or bounce, but then if Tesla could hold above 300, we could try a bigger one. If we can't hold 300, we might hit the low the the low 290s, then reject and start dipping again towards these lows. So, I just wanted to give you guys a heads up about that. That's what we're seeing so far. Anyways, let's talk about what's happening with President Trump and Elon Musk. What's going on between these two guys who went from being best friends to total enemies. Um, so the first thing that happened was Elon Musk was very honest and he said that he's sorry, he just can't stand it anymore. The massive, outrageous, pork- fililled congressional spending bill is a disgusting abomination. Shame on those who voted for it. You know who you are. You know it. So, he's once again criticizing the spending bill under President Trump. And he went on about how President Trump is not, you know, living up to his words about cutting spending because, you know, Musk claims we're going to be adding $2.5 trillion to our federal deficit because of this spending bill. So, he's very unhappy about this. He expressed his frustration and he went on about that for quite a while. Um, as a result, you know, President Trump was obviously not happy about that. He ended up criticizing Elon Musk. So, he said all of this, we have the quotes right over here. He said that he would have won Pennsylvania regardless of Elon. He's very disappointed with Elon. That's what President Trump said. He said that Elon knew this bill better than anyone and he only developed a problem when he found out I would cut the EV mandate. So that's what he said initially. Um obviously Musk claims this is not true. Um President Trump is accusing Elon Musk of having Trump derangement syndrome. He's saying that some embrace and others become very hostile. He's not happy with the way Musk has been responding. Musk said that without me Trump would have lost the election. Democrats would control the House and the Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate. Then you guys can see they used to be friends, now they're just enemies. You know, they used to have that bromance. now they're just they're just not getting along. Um, so then you know, President Trump started saying that Elon was wearing thin. I asked him to leave. I took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy electric cars that nobody else wanted. And he knew that for months uh he was going to do it. And then he's saying that Elon Musk went crazy as a result. So he called Musk crazy. Musk said that this is a lie. He's calling Trump a liar. He's not happy about this. Um, so you know, one thing that's worth mentioning is that Elon Musk has been saying that in response to President Trump, you know, he should just keep the EV/s solar incentive cuts in the bill, also cut all the crazy spending increases in the ugly bill. He's telling President Trump this after what he just said. Um, so that doesn't seem uh 100% like what we would have we would be expecting in a way because like I know Musk is saying that Tesla's going to be completely fine if we get the incentive cuts, but that's not entirely true. Um, I think that what I believe is that in the long term, yes, Tesla will be fine and Musk is very forwardlooking. But for the shorter term, Tesla will be affected by the cuts. If we see the EV mandate disappear, if we if we get these tax credits just decreasing or if they they're just eliminated, it could be hurting Tesla's sales to some extent. So, President Trump is saying the easiest way to save money in our budgets, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. That's a very, very big claim right there. He was always surprised that Biden didn't do it. So, now he's straight up saying that he wants to cut Musk's subsidies and contracts. He's not happy with him. That's why Musk was just saying like, \"Keep the cuts. It's okay. He's not wor right about that. He's calling President Trump's bill big and ugly.\" It's crazy, guys. They're just continuing to go back and forth and back and forth. And then in response to this, Musk also said that in the light of the president's statement about the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. So now, you know, it's getting more serious. They're criticizing each other even more. So, that's very, very big news, you know, coming out from President Trump. Then Elon Musk accused President Trump of something. He said something else which I can't really say on this channel. He called it a big bomb. It's like big news. Um, not the best of news. Once again, this feud is continuing. And then what Musk just said is that the Trump tariffs will cause recession in the second half of this year. He said this in response to the co-creator of Dogecoin, what they just said. So now Musk is saying that he's against the Trump tariffs. It's not a good idea. It's going to cause a recession. Now he's going to be going down a different path. So you guys could see how this is like a domino effect, right? We had just Musk say one thing about how he doesn't like the big bill and he started to criticize Trump about that. Trump fights back, Musk fights back, Trump fights back. They're like children going back and forth in all honesty. It's crazy, man. And it's it's absolutely crazy. And now, you know, with Trump bringing up Tesla's subsidies into this, Musk saying a recession is going to come because of the tariffs. It's just insane. And we don't really like this. I think Kanye West also responded to one of the tweets and he said that, you know, he loves both of them. He doesn't want to see them fight like this. Like he kind of implied that it's it's just madness, guys. This is just absolutely insane. Um, so as a result, Tesla's selling off very very hard because of this. It still is weak. Tomorrow is going to be Friday, June 6th 6th, 2025. At 8:30 a.m., an hour before the market opens, we have the non-farm payrolls unemployment rate, labor force participation rate, and lots of payrolls data. The unemployment rate is going to be very important as we're expecting 4.2%. We'll see if we get that or not. So, please keep that in mind. On top of this, Broadcom also had their very important earnings. They did relatively well. Uh looking at the second quarter earnings, they actually beat expectations, which is not too bad, but it's not really enough to save the market. So, what's going to be affecting us is what we see tomorrow in terms of the news. What will Elon Musk and President Trump announce? And then secondly, the question is what's going to be going on with um the overall picture right over here. Are we going to see um some good unemployment numbers? Are they going to be bad and cause us to dip again? That's what we're going to be watching for because Tesla's down 14%. And I do expect us to see a small rebound. Um, it's not going to be I can't promise if it's going to be massive. We need to reclaim at least 310 over here. If we get back above like this 310 area at the 200 EMA, we could try a bigger bounce. If we can't do that, there's going to be a risk of us seeing a small rebound to like the 290s and we'll see if we break past that or not. If not, we could be rejecting. So, keep that in mind. So, with that being said, what do I think is going to happen? Well, we might see a small rebound for like the 290s. Uh we could see like 294 for example on Tesla. Small gap up. But typically when you gap up the move is not going to last forever. We need to see Tesla get back above 300 and 310. If we reclaim 310 we could be looking for a bigger bounce. We want to reclaim the 200 EMA to be more bullish. You want to get back above this red line right here. And I just can't promise that guys. Like as of right now this news is very negative. So if we push and we can't reclaim 300, we might hit like 294 and then reject. So we gap up and then we start rejecting, start dipping to fill that gap, taking us back down to 280 or below. So watch and see how things end up going. Unfortunately, Tesla's looking very weak amidst this news and the tensions and there's going to be a risk of more downside even for the broader markets and that could also slow us down. On the daily time frame, we're looking weak, very weak on the daily. My concern is we have this gap down here at 235. There's another gap over here around 258. If 275 fills on Tesla, we could be filling this first gap around 257 and then a second gap over here. So you want to be very careful. So also the daily is getting a big rejection. We have high volume selling on Tesla. It looks weak head and shoulders. So much for a big run approaching the robo taxi event starting now. It may still run approaching the event, but that may take a little bit longer than previously expected. Tesla may continue to fall first. Yes, this could be a potential buying opportunity, but you have to see where we bottom. We're not done with the bottom yet. We might not be done yet. It may take Tesla another like couple of days, another week to truly see confirmation of a bottom. So, I want to give you guys a warning about that, right? You want to like be careful with your buys. You don't want to just go all in at once. You're going to slowly dollar cost average if you want to start going long. I do believe there's going to be a good long opportunity before the robo taxi event. We will be looking for a big bounce, but we're not ready yet. It could take another week. It could take another two weeks. We'll see how it ends up going. So, for now, look at this as an opportunity. Could we dip more? It's possible. I believe it's not a bad idea to dollar cost average down the more this drops. Um, but be careful because there's no guarantee the bottoms in yet. If we can't hold 275, we could be dipping into the next two gaps. Um, I don't know if we we go that low, but for now, we're just going to be looking for this one day at a time. We're looking for a rebound towards 290 to 295. I do I do think we might be testing that. Um we got to get back above like 310 to really be bullish. If we can't hold above the 300s, we could kind of push here, then reject and see a big move back down. So keep that in mind. For SPY, we're looking kind of weak here. Now, keep in mind that on the 4hour time frame, well, on the daily time frame, there's a bearish divergence. And on the 4 hour, we have a double bearish divergence. We need to see SPY get back above 598 to really rebound. If we can't do that, we're going to be at risk of retesting 589 or below for more potential downside. So, keep that in mind. On the QQQ, we have a double bearish divergence. We need to try to get back above 528. If we can't hold above 528, we're also looking kind of bearish right here off this double bearish divergence. So, we're also favoring like an attempt to kind of rebound like this. And if we can't hold above 528 to 530, we could rejax and start dipping towards 520. And if we don't hold that, we're looking for 517 to 515. The gap fill if that ends up failing. So keep that in mind. By the way, for spy, I forgot to draw this out for you guys to make this a little bit easier. It might try a rebound tomorrow. A small one. We need to try to hold above 598 to be bullish. If we come short, we could reject and start dipping lower for 590 or below. So keep that in mind. For the IWM, we're kind of trading sideways. If we break this 211 area, we could be pushing higher. But if we lose 206, we're looking for a dump back down to 204. Um, so watch and see what kind of reaction we get. Can we hit this 210 area and reject or do we continue to push for ES? We could be retesting 5959. I want to see us break past like 5980 to really continue. If we can't get back above that, it might just be like a small push here and then a rejection all the way back down to the low 5900s. So just give this some time. We're rejecting, rejecting, rejecting off 6,000. We're really struggling to hold above 6,000. I know this looked like a cup and handle, but we're not really getting confirmation of a break yet. We got to break 6,000 to be bullish, and if we can't do that, this triple bearish divergence could still pan out. So, please keep that in mind as time goes on. We're still looking for that as a potential setup. For NQ, we're looking like we have a triple bearish divergence. We need to hold above 21,629 and also 21,800 to be bullish. you need to reclaim this resistance right here to continue to push. If we can't do that, we could push and reject back down towards the lower levels. So, I do think we'd test 21,629 tomorrow, but we might not hold above that. We could touch this and reject like this. We're still looking kind of weak off a triple bearish divergence. Bitcoin took a hit. We had this blue trend line acting as support and it failed. So, now we're looking for 101,250 is our support. There's also a risk of more downside, especially because Bitcoin is very correlated with the market. Notice that we have this left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. If we could hold above 105,000, we could try to bounce if we can't get back above that. And if we end up losing 101,000, we could be dipping into much lower levels, such as this high over here around 97,000. So, just keep that in mind. For Tesla, we're going to see how things end up going right here. We're going to try some kind of rebound move. Um, a small rebound move is very possible to like 295ish. I could see that, but then there's no guarantee we hold up. It might retest 290 to 295 and then reject again and we could be retesting these lows. And then keep in mind if we can't hold 275 on Tesla, I wouldn't be surprised if we come down to fill the next gap down here around 258. And there's another gap. So, it's not looking good, guys. We look weak in all honesty. For now, we just have to follow the trend with and with what Elon Musk and President Trump say. I I'm sure they're going to be talking more tomorrow. So, this feud is nowhere near done. They're just going to continue to criticize each other. Nvidia has a bearish divergence. We need to get back above 142 to bounce. If not, we could be looking for essentially 137 then 135 and we'll see how this ends up going. For Apple, we got this rejection. We're going to be watching to see if 202 holds. If not, we could be dipping back down to 198. So, be careful. This could be dipping even more. For Netflix, we're looking a bit more bullish right now. Um, this is looking to basically approach this 1280 area. MSTR or Micro Strategy is rejecting. We want to see if 362 holds. If not, we could be dipping back down to fill this gap around 351. Celsius looks a bit more bullish. We're trying to hold up right here. Looking for an attempt to get back up to 41. We have to hold above 41 to push. If not, we could be rejecting. Super Micro is rejecting. We want to see if this could hold above 42 plus. If not, we're going to be at risk of dipping to about 39 all over again. Palanteer and the daily is kind of weak. We're going to see if 123 holds. If not, we could be dumping to about 112.89. Rivian is rejecting making lower highs. We're going to see if 13.8 holds. If not, we could be dipping back down to about 13 flat. So, if I got a rejection, there's also kind of like a head and shoulders. We need to see if we hold 13. If not, we could be dumping. So, watch for a test of 13.3 and then 13. We'll see if we bounce. AMD is rejecting on the daily off. We got to hold above 120 to be bullish. If not, we could be returning to 112. And I do see there's a risk of 112 tomorrow. ARM is making lower highs. It actually kind of has like a head and shoulders. We need to hold above 132. If not, we could be looking for 127 and 123. PayPal is also rejecting off the 200 EMA. We have to see if 72.5 holds. If not, we could be looking for 70.76. For Coinbase, we have a left shoulder, a head, and then a right shoulder. Watch and see if 244 holds. If not, we could be dipping to about um 232. Uh if that fills us, there's a big gap to fill below all the way down here around 210. So, be careful. Amazon is rejecting. We're going to see if we hold above 210. If not, we could be dipping back down to 205. Meta is at resistance. We're going to see if 690 holds. If not, we could be dipping towards 6. And um actually, it's going to be 675. That's going to be tested first. We'll see if that holds. If not, we could turn lower. Google has to hold 169.85. If it does not hold this, we're going to be at risk of dipping towards 168. So, please keep that in mind as time goes on. Um, for a few more, we have Microsoft, which is looking bullish, looking for intent for 470. We'll see if we bounce off 470 to continue to push. That's also going to be very key for how we end up moving the 10-year, not the 10ear. DJT is kind of weak here. Got a big dump here. There's a big head and shoulders up here. we could be dumping back down towards 18. Uh the VIX is looking bullish on the 4 hour. If we could break past 19, this is going to continue to run, especially as we have a gap that's unfilled all the way up here. So, if we break 19, we're looking for an attempt to fill the gap at 22. For the 10-year, we have a gap as well. And then also the uh dollar index is kind of flat here. So, give this some time to develop. So, with that being said, I want to thank you all so much for listening. The 10-year uh the dollar is kind of like weak right We're going to see if this bounces or not, but Tesla stock still looks weak. I do think we could gap up tomorrow, try a small push. We'll see if we get back above 300. If we can't do that, if we just stop in the low 290s, this could kind of gap up and then reject and start tipping again if we get more bad news from Elon Musk and President Trump. Once again, Elon Musk Elon Musk just said that he thinks there's going to be a recession now in the second half of this year. So, my point is there could be more news like this tomorrow. We also have the unemployment numbers coming out in the morning, so we'll see what that leads to. Make sure you're ready for all of this. And I thank you all so much for listening. I I really appreciate you guys so much for your attention. I'll see you guys tomorrow before market open. Until then, have a good one and peace out."
