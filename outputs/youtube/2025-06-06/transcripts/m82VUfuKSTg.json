  "title": "ðŸ”¥BREAKING: HUGE BULLISH CATALYST? SPY, ES, QQQ, NQ, NVDA, AAPL, TSLA PREDICTIONS! ðŸš€",
  "transcript": "What's up, guys? It's Ray J back with another video. And in this one, I want to break down what's happening with the overall markets. I want to break down why the market saw an initial sell-off only to see a very, very nice size bounce ever since we heard some news that came out from President Trump. Just know that I am not a financial planner. Take nothing I'm saying as financial advice. Anyways, when we opened, the market sold off quite a bit. We saw SPY drop to the 593s. However, we did not end up holding below 595. We actually got bought back up above that. And now we made a full recovery and we're starting to rally a bit. Ever since President Trump made his announcements, the market started to bounce and that was the catalyst that's helping the market push. So the question is what did President Trump just say that caused the market to bounce? What's going on with these levels? I'll talk about them in just a second. I first want to talk about what's happening with President Trump. So as the market's holding up, it does have the potential to go higher, especially if SPY holds 598. But this is the news that came out that caused the market to bounce. President Trump said that he just concluded a very good phone call with PresidentQi of China discussing some of the intricacies of their recently made and agreed to trade deal. The call lasted about one and a half hours. It was very positive. He went on about that. It was positive for both of the countries and there should not be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products. Their teams will be meeting shortly. So we have like Bessence, Lutnik and many other representatives who are going to be negotiating which is good news. And also President Xiai invited the first lady Melania Trump and President Trump to visit China and then he reciprocated meaning that he also invited them back. So very very good news you know from both nations. He said that they're looking forward to trade and the conversation was almost entirely focused on trade. They did not really discuss Russia, Ukraine or Iran. They were just talking about trade for about one and a half hours and he's saying it was a very good call. So that's very optimistic, right? The market loves that. That's why the market's pushing. so far. But the question is can the market sustain these levels. Um there was some news that came out about how our overall imports did decrease compared to the previous reports. Um this may be due to the higher tariffs especially on China. Um that's why the overall deficit also decreased as a result. However, moving forward we just have like Cougler from the Fed giving a speech soon and nothing else that's too significant. So that's what we're seeing on the news. I also have President Trump's transcript. I'm going to read a couple of things real quick then I'll talk about the charts. Um before that actually we have President Xi the leader of China said some super important things. I think that's also positive for the markets. He said that um the US should remove the negative measures on China. They should increase their cooperation on the economy and trade and they also said that China has followed through on their agreement in Switzerland. So overall they're saying that things went really well. Then they said that both sides should enhance exchanges in diplomatic, economics, trade, military and law enforcement. And they made a good call overall. Then we had President Trump saying that um you know both sides have benefited from this. Um they respect one another. Um he went on about how he's been invited as well to China and how overall they've made some good progress. He also said that no more questions should be asked about rare earth uh products with China and they had a very very good call overall. So President Trump went on about that and he basically said the same things over and over again. So that's what we heard from President Trump thus far. Um so overall you know the market likes this news. The fact that we had a good um a good discussion between our leaders the leader of China and President Trump and then also our other leaders such as like Bessence Lutnik and many other representatives are going to be negotiating you know trade deals. So that's very very good news so far and the market loves this. So we look bullish on spy we look a bit more bullish if we could sustain these levels. The question is can we sustain this? Um, so we have this like cup and handle like structure. If we break 598 and hold it, you want to see us push for 600 plus 602 would be coming. For now, we're going to be looking for 600 as our target. If we want to be bearish, you want to see us lose 595 to start dumping. As of right now, we are favoring upside with the cup and handle. So, we want to see if 598 holds on SPY. If it does, I'm looking for 600 on the QQQ. Same thing. We have this cup and handle like structure. Can we hold above 530? If we lose that, we could be dipping back down to 525. As long as we're above 530, we're favoring 535 as a potential target. As we look more bullish on the IWM, we look more bullish. We also have this nice cup and handle like structure. Um, I want to see us hold support. So, if we break 211, we're looking for an attempt for like 212 as our target. Eventually 215 above that. As long as we don't lose 206, we're looking more bullish. ES has a very, very nice looking cup and handle. It's looking bullish for now, but that depends on if we can hold these levels. There's a cup, there's a handle. Can we break and hold 6,000 to push for 6,50 plus? If we end up losing 5965, we're going to be turning back down. For now, we have a cup and handle. We're favoring the 6,000s as we look more bullish. And Q's looking bullish with the cup and handle. I want to see if we could break past 22,000. I think we could be going for 22,000 so long as we don't lose 21,800. So, overall, we're doing a fantastic job at holding up. Um, so that's a good piece of news at least thus far. Um, as long as ES continues to hold an NQ that could be very beneficial for Bitcoin. We have this blue trend line acting as our support. So keep in mind that's going to be where our um support happens to be. As long as we hold this, we could be looking for a nice attempt to rebounce towards 106,000, but we have to hold that for confirmation. So make sure you watch that very carefully. One thing that's very interesting is that Bitcoin is kind of like leading the way the market's been moving for quite some time. Um, this doesn't always happen. It could also be like a coincidence. Um, but if anything, I just want to say that we're holding up very well and there is still potential to go higher, especially with the optimism with China, at least thus far. Um, so keep that in mind, guys. That's what we're seeing at least thus far on the news and such. For Tesla, I just want to say this chart isn't looking that great. So, we got this massive rejection. We dumped quite a bit, but notice we have this red line down here. I know it's a little hard to see. This red line is actually our 200 EMA at this 301 area. If Tesla loses that, we could be dumping back down to fill the gap to 300. We got to hold that to bounce back up for 325, then eventually 330. So, overall, could I see Tesla bounce more? Yes, but I need to see us hold 322.5 and then 325 to bounce. If we lose 311, we could be dipping more. So keep that in mind. For Nvidia, I think we're doing a fantastic job. We have a cup and handle like structure. If we break 144, we're looking for a bigger push. And if we end up losing 139, we're going to be dipping back down. We're still looking a bit more bullish for now if we break this resistance. So great job by Nvidia so far. Apple's looking good, especially because Apple's very China dependent. Apple depends a lot on China. So hearing that President Trump is speaking with China is great news. Um if we end up losing 202, we could turn back down. As long as we're above that, we're favoring 206 plus. We're looking more bullish for now on Apple. For others out there like Palunteer, as long as we hold 129, we're favoring an imbalance fill for 133. For AMD, we're looking decent. I don't want to see us lose 116. As long as we're above that, we're favoring a retest of like 120 almost. Although, it's kind of shuffling here. It's not as strong. It might slowly push closer to that area. Coinbase has an inverse head and shoulders. So long as we don't bl 252, we're favoring 268 as a very pragmatic target. Um, Amazon's looking bullish. As long as we don't boost 207, we're also favoring the upwards direction for essentially these highs over here. So, this is kind of like a cup and handle. 214 is likely coming next as long as we're above 210. Meta is looking good. We need to hold above 69 to push for 700. It's at a tough resistance. We came very close to 700. We're still technically bullish, but if we end up losing like 685, we could turn down lower. For now, we're holding up well and we could be going higher. For Google, we look bullish. As long as we don't lose 170, we're favoring 173 as a potential target. Um, Microsoft is looking good. So long as we don't lose 462, we're also favoring 470. So, we're looking good so far. The VIX is looking bearish as we're making lower highs. So, overall, we're doing a fantastic job. Anyways, that's it for this one. I thank you all so much for listening. So, please enjoy the rest of your guys' days. The market's looking a bit more bullish for now. We'll see what happens with President Trump and his announcements as time goes on, but for now, we're looking quite good. Anyways, thank you for listening. I'll keep you guys updated on any more updates. Until then, I'll see you guys very, very soon. Thank you for listening and peace"
