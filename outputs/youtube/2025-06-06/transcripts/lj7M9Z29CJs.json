  "transcript": "[Music] Good afternoon. Welcome to the Theot Trade Afternoon video. I am Blake Young and today is June 5th, 2025 and we're going to talk about jobs data, real estate, and consumer discretionary spending. So, as we're starting this, I do want you to take a quick note of where the S&P 500 rejected the 50% fair price on our monkey bars. This is a key barrier. Now, that's not a strong resistance, per se, but an area that I expect consolidation when we reach these fair prices or the 50% levels, and I talked about the $600 target a couple of days ago. This is where I expect it to chop. And today's candle, even though it's not a huge sell-off, today's candle is a higher high, lower low at that key level with a bearish stochastics divergence. So, this does feel like a top. Now, being a top in the market with everything that's gone on, regardless of whether the call with President Xi went surprisingly well or very good, it doesn't really matter from a technical perspective. We've found fair price, a balance area. We've widened out the trading candles. So that means we cleared out buyers and sellers and we have a bearish divergence that says it wants to go back down to these low areas which means about 580. So I am looking for about a 15 point drop in the S&P 500 and that's going to be equivalent to about a 2% correction 2 and a half% correction in the S&P 500. But let's take a look at something else on the QQQ or the NASDAQ. What we have is a retest of the same fair price for the month at 530 and the annual fair price. So this fair price at 50% at 525 is what we'd expect from a week-to-eek view based off of last year. So the entire year being quantified as a distribution, this is saying this is fair price. So we sold off to a fair price down here. We recovered to a fair price here. This is where we expect some consolidation and it can be a short-term resistance if we get volume sell-off. You'll notice we're creating a similar bearish divergence with lower highs versus higher highs in price. And as we're looking at that move, we created a higher high, lower low, very similar to what we saw in the S&P 500. A widening candle is increased volatility and clearing out buyers and sellers. And so now price can prevail despite the fact that there's some uncertainty. It appears that we found fair price and possibly put in a top in the QQQ. But what we want to talk about is if this resistance area or this top in the market, this fair price has been reached and whether economic data will support a breakout or a collapse. And tomorrow we have non-farm payroll. We've already had ADP. We've already got science and clues going into this, including non-farm payroll from ADP and weekly unemployment claims. what are they telling us and what might we expect tomorrow? And what we saw on Wednesday was a huge miss in ADP non-farm payroll. Now, it used to be Johnny and I talked about this in the main room. It used to be a lot more significant because ADP report was actual checks cut rather than a survey. But years ago, I think it's 2007208, they did switch over to do a survey methodology similar to the way that non-farm payroll does. Well, even still, they missed. They missed huge. This 37,000 jobs being added versus the projected 111,000 is horrendous. It is a major miss and showing that we do not have hiring going on. Now, we had Jolts show us that there's more job openings, but as we look at this and look at the data, this is the lowest monthly number outside of the massive correction in 2022 and 2021. So, we have a bigger drop in the COVID thing, but as far as the post pandemic lockdowns, we had two times that we went negative. Outside of that, this is the worst. This is the worst data that we've had in ADP. So, this is probably predictive or telling us what we might expect in non-farm payroll on Friday. If I move it forward to today, you're going to also notice our weekly unemployment claims rose to 247,000. And that is a highest point other than those similar layoffs in 2024. And here we're approaching the third highest weekly new unemployment claims. This is not accumulative. It's weekly new unemployment claims. And so we're seeing rising unemployment. We're seeing misses in unemployment. And even if we're expecting non-farm payroll tomorrow to show us that we're going to have 126,000 jobs this time, the problem is that has already been revised down once. So we already add in 135, 140, then it went down last time was 177. They've revised it down to 126. And now the next revision, which is not going to show up here, they're already showing that they've revised it down to 110. So from the previous to this time, previous last month to this expected forecast is 110. And if we miss the 110 like ADP did, we're talking about 33,000. And the data is going to show again this is bad news for unemployment. So the question is does the unemployment or the employment situation end up being so bad that we are forced to cut rates and that spurs the market higher or is this the the crack in the infrastructure? Is this what we're going to see as failure in our current market conditions when it comes down to economic conditions weighing on the US economy which is going to bring us to real estate and discretionary spending. So, if we're going to see more and more people without jobs, if we're seeing these get weaker and weaker, and this could be a miss and could be a significant miss in non-farm payroll tomorrow, then what will that do to real estate? What will that do real estate demand? What will that do to consumer discretionary spending? And can we see clues or hints coming from home builders and credit cards? So, if we take a look over here and we're go to QQQ, we're going to change this. I do want you to remember I've talked about XLY as not a great representation of consumer discretionary because too much Tesla's in there today. Tesla got sold off hard. So, the fact that we're down 3%. Tesla accounts for almost 15% of this. And so, if I put Tesla into the chart, telling you not don't take this sell off as full value in consumer discretionary because Tesla's down 16 a.5%. It's a an amazing selloff. We've gone from 370 down to 270. We're talking about a 35% decline in a matter of a week. So that move is really making the consumer discretionary sector look worse than it is. So we would want to take that component out when we're looking at XLY. But XLY is still down. It's still selling off. And I'm going to be looking at this to say, are you going to break through 207? Because we can still trade consumer discretionary. If it breaks through 207, it's not just Tesla. If it breaks through 207, we should be falling down to 194. That's telling us that consumers are not likely to be spending money in those areas or at least the market is going to price in lack of spending to the consumer discretionary stocks including Amazon. If I look at Visa, Visa is the total number of transactions really more than anything. It's not a matter of how much debt, it's how many times we're running our credit card. And Visa had a gap up and close down. This is an exhaustion gap. And if we get through the low 36631 versus 3 Oops, hang on. There we go. 36632. Oh, guess what? We just did it. We just broke through. So now we created a widening candle here at the previous high and a bearish divergence in Visa. This is all showing me that the consumer is not safe. The consumer is struggling. And if the consumer is struggling, they would normally go to their quote unquote piggy bank, their mattress, and dig out some cash. And that is their homes, their home values. But the concerning thing there is that home values have fallen in 60% of the metropolitan areas. 60% of the metropolitan areas has seen home prices fall. And so we're getting less value in our home. and and that we're we're talking about just in April and we're seeing less value in our home. Mortgage rates are at high levels and if we're have mortgage rates at high levels and less value in home, there's less to borrow to pay off credit card. There's less to borrow to continue our spending patterns. If I take a look at homebuilders, we can see that we've bounced up, entered into the overbought and closed down. This is not a strong recovery. We, yes, we bounced off the monkey bars, but we went endzone to end zone and show failure here. And unless we can get through 93, I expect homebuilders to fall back to 88. And I would pick the specific stocks inside of home builders and say which one gives me the best reward risk or which one has the highest probabilities of selling off. Toll Brothers is at a short-term resistance and fair price. Dr. Horton is just about to break free from the monkey bars. If it breaks free from 121, I expect 116. And we could go through PY. PY has a bearish signal today. And PY is giving us a bearish breakout and a target down to 96. And so looking at these, we're getting about a 5% correction to the downside just as a short-term target. But if home prices stay high and consumers stay leveraged up, this is meaning that they're not going to be demanding new home construction. It means that they're not going to be borrowing against their own homes and certainly not going to be upgrading. And if we look at the 10-year Treasury note, the question is, do you think that we're going to see yields go down? Well, we tried to cross down yesterday and we've bumped back up through this monkey bar. This is a 10-year Treasury yield. And the last two months, we've traded almost perfectly endzone to endzone on the monkey bars in the previous month. But now we're here at the zero. If we break through 4460, I expect rates to go up to 47 or 48, which means that 4.75, we'll use that as an example. 4.75 means that we're going to be back to 7% borrowing rates. And when many people have a 3% mortgage rate, they will not refinance. And if they're not going to refinance, they're not paying off their credit cards to be able to spend more. They're not using their house as that peg piggy bank to borrow more and spend more. So again, I think the consumer is going to be strapped for cash. They're not going to be borrowing from their home. They're going to be maxing out their credit cards. They are not going to be choosing to go into consumer discretionary spending and buying the things that are unnecessary. If we see job data show worse than expected, falling employment, rising unemployment, and rates that are remaining high, this is a recipe for massive market slowdown and an economic slowdown, not just in the US, but globally. And if we're betting on the consumer not spending discretionary spending, yes, Tesla's down a lot, I would focus on the hotel, restaurants, and leisure. This hotel, restaurants, and leisure is the area that we can look closer at. And maybe not McDonald's, but Starbucks, Las Vegas Sands, Win, MGM, Booking, Airbnbs, Marriott, Hilton, Royal Caribbean, and Carnival all are stocks that I would be looking for bearish setups on bad economic data. MTM is giving us a bearish monkey bar breakout, which says we should be dropping down to 29 and retesting the recent lows. Las Vegas Sands is not a sell signal, but definitely rolling over at the highs with a slightly lower high through here. I would like to see it break through 39 and even more so 38 to give us that target. And Royal Caribbean has reached up and touched the overbought, not put in a new 52- week high. A failure here and reversal could see price fall back to 240. I think Royal Caribbean is way overextended and so I will be looking to sell call verticals up here creating the opportunity to trade it all the way back down through here if we do just simply buy a put. But I do think Royal Caribbean is way overextended for the current price action and the economic conditions. Those are the areas I'm watching and tomorrow really could be the catalyst as we're continuing to sell off even now. Even as I'm doing this, we're selling off more and more and more. And so we're confirming what I'm saying as far as being a potential top in the market as I'm recording this video. So if that's the case and we have a bad report tomorrow, watch for the ones that will get the most immediate changes and behaviors which are going to be the things that are not necessary in this market, in this environment. And tomorrow really could be the catalyst to set us up for the next couple of months in those bearish trades on homebuilders consumer discretionary and specifically leisure. But that's going to do it for me today. Thanks for watching. Join us tomorrow live in the morning so we can break down the non-farm payroll data and everything else is going on in this market, this wild willy market. But again, have a great day. We will talk to you tomorrow."
