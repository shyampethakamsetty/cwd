  "transcript": "Today's market call is presented by Faxet, financial data and analytics powered by tomorrow and SoFi. Get your money right all in one [Applause] app. 5th of June, it's a Thursday. It's 11:00 a.m. It's Dan Nathan. It's Gwizz. It's Mario from SoFi providing some work that he did. Um, of course, the great Elizabeth Young Thomas will be back with us at some point this year, postmaternity leave, if she's watching. Hello, Elizabeth. We miss you. Dan, how are you? I'm doing great. By the way, guy, I don't even know if you know this, but Mario is going to be at Fast Money Live tonight. He's a huge Fast Money fan. Huge guy. No, he's not. He emailed me yesterday. I said, \"What's the attire?\" He goes, \"I was ready to go. Full Guy Dami.\" You know what the Full Guyami is? Suit and tie, baby. Not it up. That's exactly it. I said, \"You know what? You're better than that.\" I said that, \"You know what? You're better than that. You roll in however you roll in because you're gonna That's it. I mean, listen, I don't try to idiosyncrasies on to others.\" That's right. You know, the fact that men now wear sneakers with suits, I I'm I'm offended by it, but I I I acknowledge their right to do so. Yeah. You know, people, when I look off to the side, I'm just looking at Bill snickering because uh Bill knows I'm right. No, he knows. He thinks you're funny. Okay. He thinks I am funny. He's a comedian. He's a comedian. Um so, we're going to meet Mario for the first time face to face. That's going to be exciting. Um watch the show tonight. You guys are going to sit to see Guy leave the set, go into the crowd, take questions, and this is not him hamming it out. It's just who Guy is. People, the next time we do a live show, you got to come. We got to see Gyodami in the wild. Um guy in the wild. In the wild. You know what else is wild? Nice segue. This S&P 500. Oh, there you go. Where you can't keep a good market down. And this morning, I think the futures were sort of unchanged. We got an initial spike on the news that President Trump had a phone call with President Xi. Um the market sold off subsequent. Now we're back to where we started. Uh, you know, there's that old saying, I guess, never short a dull market. And it's not that things are dull, but you know, the when in the absence of news, the market just does this levitation. And and here we are yet again. Yeah. And you know, listen, we're going to offer a trade idea using options to actually do that thing that we just said never do to try to short a dull market. But the options market, especially where the VIX is coming in on the SPY, it's looking really attractive in the near term, right, to kind of put some either maybe short-term protection. We have not done one of these in a very long time, and we just think the timing is kind of interesting. We have CPI on Jul uh June 11th, we have the Fed meeting on June 18th. So, we're going to hit that in a few minutes. So, stick around with that. We're going to target those sorts of events. We're also going to target the fact that, you know, VA is cheap enough where to make premium directional sort of things. So, we'll uh map that out in a few minutes. Um, one of the first things that I read every morning, and I think you do too, guy, is Early Morning with Dave. Dave would be David Rosenberg. Rosie, Rosie. Um, I thought this was really interesting. Um, and so he's saying outside pandemic era distortions, the S&P 500's 28day rally from the lows, nearly 20% was the fastest such move since 09. So that means that back in April, the index is now up one and a half% for the year and within 3% of its all-time highs. Interestingly, for the economic standpoint, the rally has not been led by growth. Defenses have joined the party as well. So a lot of the headlines are that, you know, Meta's ripback this and that, whatever. I mean, a big part of that or Nvidia or whatever the names are that you're looking at is that they were down a lot more than the S&P 500. So when you see Rosie kind of point this out, guy, it's the fastest gain, the fastest V reversal since the financial crisis. What does that make you think? Well, you know, I didn't realize it was 09, but I knew it was somewhat historic. Um, I don't know what I think quite honestly. I know what I thought in early April, and we talked about it. I thought the market had probably gotten ahead of itself to the downside. I mean, everybody was seemingly on that side of the boat. The oversold condition was at levels we had not seen in quite some time and we thought the market would bounce. Now I thought the market could get to like 5650 5700 in the S&P and we clearly overshot that. Um but here we are. So what do I think now? Well this is what I think. As quickly as we got ourselves to an oversold condition, that's how quickly we've gotten ourselves to an overbought condition. And those valuations, again, not a timing tool, but the valuations that were concerning for a lot of people for so long, have gotten themselves right pretty much back to where they were. And that includes includes a number of different metrics. You know, we talked about the cape ratio, the Buffett indicator, just price to earnings in the S&P overall. And they're all once again flashing red. So, I'm not quite certain why the market is so optimistic or just so to use a word that we've used now a number of times, complacent. But here we are. Yeah. And I guess Ros's point here is also that given all of the uncertainty, we've heard it from businesses, we've heard it from central bankers, right? It goes on and on. We've seen some of the consumer data here. Um it seems to be that the market is kind of divorced from the concerns about that, which kind of leads you to that whole um idea of complacency, which is why I want to hit um Liz and Mario's note here so you know where to get their work. It's at the SoFi investing blog. You can go there. Look at Look at I mean, can I do it this time? Yeah, go ahead. I love this. Sofi.com-thed-money. Yeah, there you go. Um, by the way, I think you get a little jealous. There's a little FOMO that I get to do that each. Yeah, I just wanted to do it because it's fun. It is. It is fun, actually. So, you can get all their great stuff there. You can get their weekly blog uh there. You can sign up for it and get it in your uh inbox there. Okay. So, this is what they're looking at right here. Since the April 8th market bottom, the S&P 500 is up 20%, the MAG7 is up 30% while AI related stocks are up 45 and a half%. This kind of smacks in the face a little bit of what Rosie was just saying, but maybe guy, it's just semantics. You know, we talked about the MAG 7 really kind of underperforming to the downside when the market started selling off and it's obviously gotten a lot bit uh more of that back. I think what Rosie is saying is that you've seen broader participation of some groups that you might think not be leading the way, right? So, we're talking about breath, I guess. And there are a lot of people, if you watch Fast Money, Tim Seymour, you talk about it. A lot of those names that are in the Magnificent 7, I can't believe I just said it, but because it's up there, you did, have become defensive. I I know that's somewhat counterintuitive, but you know, for market participants, they view a number of these stocks as exactly that. So when there's seemingly un seeming unrest in the broader market, the participants will flock to these names as perceived safety or defensiveness in nature, which listen, maybe it makes sense for Facebook on valuation. Maybe Google may be on valuation, Apple obviously is everybody's love child, but I'm not certain that's really the right course of action. Yeah, I I guess if you broaden this out also, this goes back to Ros's um not just what we're seeing right here is that, you know, you have an Nvidia that's only up 6% and you know, this has been lapping S S&P performance for the last three years or so. You have Apple that's still down 19% on the year. You have Amazon that's down 4% on the year. You have Google that's down 10% on the year. And you have Tesla, which is down 4% today, down 21% on the year. Right? And so when I look at some of these stocks that are actually outperforming the S&P 500, that fits in a bit into what Rosie um is kind of seeing. So I I get it. I think both of these data points are really useful. Let's go to the next slide. Decoding markets riding the wave. This is from Mario. Despite broader me uh macroeconomic uncertainties, the big four hyperscalers are now expected to spend $311 billion on capex in 2025 versus 304 billion at the end of uh April. And what's interesting to me, so the annual growth of 43.3% versus 40.2%. Is that, and you've been making this point, is that the rate of these capex increases has obviously been slowing a great deal. And that's I think the overall the overarching um point that for whatever reason and maybe I'm wrong to bring it up but you know the numbers are bigger the rate of change is smaller and at some point that rate of change excuse me flattens out which is normal by the way I mean you talk about this all the time I mean there is a growth trajectory that sort of stalls out and then you get sort of the other side of that mountain. Now, I guess for names like Nvidia, what's sort of kept these things what's kept that stock somewhat afloat is the fact that margins are holding in there. I will say much to my surprise, last quarter, obviously we saw a deceleration, but they explained that away. We saw a bit of an uptick this quarter, but I think to me it's just sort of a matter of time before you start to see deterioration in margins. And that's when I think the story, not that their stories are bad, but that's when the stock stories start to fall in more difficult times. So again, absolute numbers, huge rate of change, not so much anymore. Yeah. Second bullet I think is important. It's something we've also been highlighting. So the timing extent of any potential overinvestment are unknowable in advance. But for now, robust spending plans uh make it unlikely that the AI theme will fall apart. Now you could take the other side of that. You have used this term the sanctity all right of capex. And you know at some point um and we saw this in 2022 when some of these uh businesses slow down, the revenue growth slows down, there's pressure on margins, right? These companies have to figure out how to cut costs somewhere, right? And that 2022 was jobs. We're already seeing job announcements, job cuts, Croup today, I think Proctor and Gamble, um there was one other we know that um Microsoft has been cutting some jobs. I think Meta um you know uh you know announced some job cuts and they're small you know they're incremental but at some point if you want to start broadening out away from firing people sadly you could kind of pull back on capex and those are the sorts of things as we see unemployment go higher we know that we have that non-fire payrolls number tomorrow morning for May but we've seen some anecdotal evidence over the last not anecdotal it's actually economic data guy that we're seeing the pace of hiring flow. Exactly. The soft data, soft data has been exactly that. The hard data is starting to come in as well, which suggests, you know, a normal slowdown in the economy, which makes a lot of sense. I think that's one of the reasons why people, and when I say people, it's across a variety of of sectors and a variety of industries and a variety of basically positions calling for the Fed to lower rates. I don't think that's the end all be all that most people think. But I also saw I think right now there's a 79% chance I think of a rate cut in June which comes up I want is it next week or so? So stay tuned for that, you know, and I don't know if my numbers are right, but that's what I thought. I'm I'm not sure they are. We We'll double check. Double check. Go to Complexity or whatever. No, no. I'm going to the CME Fed Watch tracker um because um I thought the narrative yesterday was that September was ticking up. So we have June 18, maybe it was se maybe it was September, we have July, they don't have a meeting in August, but they do have that confab out there in Jackson Hole guy. You'd probably love that would be the fish you that would be the week of the year that I think you would really love to go to. So I'm looking at No, it it's a near certainty guy in June that nothing happens. Okay. So June is the No. So maybe it was. Yeah. So I got my numbers wrong. No, that's fine. And let me just look at July. Okay. So July, it's a 70 cent 70% probability that they stay put. No, that they stay put. Okay. So 30% probability that we get There he is. Okay. Look at Jacob. Just Johnny on the spot. So September is the one that it's starting to turn a little bit. And so that's just, you know, that's just sooner than expected. Okay. So all right, let's look at the S&P. This is the index of the S&P 500. Okay. And we talked about this. I'm I'm going to move to the SPY in a second because that's where we're going to do the trade idea. And so we talked about this thing. It's making this flag. It's consolidated above its 200 uh moving 200 day moving average. We see that gap above the 200 day. You may say that's really good support. Okay, 5794 is that 200 day moving average. Let's go to the spy here, guy. Okay, so this is the ETF that tracks that index. So, I just put that uptrend in there and it speaks to what Rosie just mentioned, the V reversal. It's the fastest 20% gain off of a relative low that we've seen going back to '09 if you cut out COVID. And you say to yourself, guy, could it continue to kind of, you know, walk up that line? Of course it could, right? But because we talked about where VA is right here, we have these two economic events coming in. Maybe the the data is hot on June 11th, right? And then maybe we see a Fed that remains emboldened to keep rates higher. At some point, you're going to see a retest. Would you agree of that 200 day moving average? Yeah, no doubt. I've thought that now for a while. I mean, since that little top we saw a few weeks ago, you know, when we traded back down to the moving average where I thought we would fail and break through it, that was the day obviously we held and bounced, which again surprised me a great deal. But now here we are, this pretty steep trend line. Um, the steeper the trend lines obviously the more chance of it to be broken and I think you're right to point it out. So 57 577 in the spy comes into play. I mean that probably ticks up a little bit each day. But I think that's what you're looking for. But the real question is if and when we get there, do we hold this time or is something else going on? And do we find ourselves sort of backing and filling a little bit from the move since April? That's what I think the more likely outcome is. Yeah. And so that's the kind of target to the downside guy. Um, you and I both Wait, just hold on a second. Sorry. Jeff H. would guy ever call someone bro or dude? Um, yeah. Uh, okay. Does that a lot. I'm not a big bro dude. I'm not I'm just, you know. Yeah. I don't like the question, dude. I don't like the timing of the question here. So, we're trying to kind of put this whole thing together here. Okay. So, we're talking about you might climb this thing, but by the same token, if you were to kind of go through that uptrend, retest that uh 200 day moving average, but the gap there is the one that you and I are really most focused on, especially if you break the uptrend and you break the 200 day moving average. Okay, so here's the trade. I put this on a little bit ago, and you know, the prices have moved. The market is a bit higher. So, that means this put spread is going to be cheaper here. But I like the riskreward of this. Okay. So, when the spy was trading at around 595 a.5, I bought the June 20th. Okay. That's the 20th, that's the Friday. Okay. In 3 weeks from now, basically the 59057 uh 70 put spread. I paid $4 for that. I was buying one of the June 590 puts for about $5.50. I was selling one of the June 570 puts at $150. That's how I get to that $4 in premium. That breaks even down at 5.86. Okay. And I've gains up uh to 16 between 5.86 586 and 570. That would be the gap fill. My risk is that $4 in premium between 5.86 and 590 I can lose up to $4. Okay. So, let's just talk about the riskreward here. It breaks even down at 5.86. You can do the math. That's down about $9 from there. That's one a.5%. Think about that. That's one and a half percent to the downside and down about four and a quarter percent or so. I can make up to a little more than 3%. I like the riskreward here. I'm targeting the data. I'm targeting the technicals. Um, I like the fact that I'm risking less than 1% of the ETF price. And so, you could say, well, this is not, you're not going for a lot here, but $4 to possibly make 16 if the index is down 4%. I like the riskreward here, guy. You do that every day. And this is the what I like the most about it. You're actually getting paid a decent amount for the selling those 570s. Like, I'm actually surprised that you could sell them for a buck and a half. So that obviously mitigates the cost of the put that you're buying at 590. So I think again riskreward makes sense. You're you're risking three and a half. You're risking one to make three and a half four. And I think you have a legitimate shot of this coming into the money for you given what we've seen and given some of the news flow. You know, and I've said this as well with the market seemingly ticking up every day. there's more and more I think chance that President Trump says something um that is stronger in tone because he has some basically chips to play with with this market bounce. So I I think the trade makes a lot of sense. Yeah, I think that's a really great point too. Right. So when we started this whole little foray into the trade war um you know the the administration, the Treasury Secretary of the White House, they said we're not worried about the stock market. We're targeting the US Treasury market. They wanted the the Treasury yield on the 10-year to go lower. All right, so let's go to the 10-year yield, guys. So, here we are. We see that flat 200 day moving average. Carter was on fast money with us last night. He's in the lower camp, not in the higher for longer camp. He's just focused on the technicals. You and I are thinking about that. The technicals is just one input, right? And so when we think about the reasons for which yields might go higher, if we do have a hotter uh May CPI, if we do have a Fed that's emboldened because of the uncertainty around the trade war and we're hearing from companies and talking about prices and talking about input costs and and the like and having to pass those through to uh consumers, well, that's the thing that's likely to keep the Fed, you know, kind of a bit more hawkish, right? So So what do you make of just the technicals? we see this slightly rising 200 day moving average, but we're basically the 10 year is exactly where it was a year ago. It is. So that's the 10ear if Jacob or Stephen could put up a TLT chart because over the last, you know, half hour or so, we've seen, you know, interesting. Interesting. We've seen a pretty steep decline, which coincides with this move higher in the S&P 500, which coincides with the news that President Trump just tweeted, I guess, that he had a great call with President Shei. By the way, you know, not that I'm good at anything, but one of the things that we said when President Trump tweeted at 2:00 in the morning the other night that, and I'm paraphrasing to a point, maybe Jacob can find it, but I'm very good friends with President Xi, but he's very difficult to negotiate with. There's going to be a hard negotiation or something to that effect. What I said, and it it's seemingly proven to be correct. it was going to be this underpromise overpromise underd deliver type of thing where then he subsequently says as difficult as he was to negotiate with we had a beautiful call and that's seemingly what's going on right now which I think is one of the reasons the market is rallying but as I said put up the TLT chart and take a look I mean this selloff today could create a little bit of a engulfing pattern we traded higher than yesterday's high we'll see where we close but this is absolutely worth watching in the same way that the 10-year yield the uptrend and the ups slope in the 200 day moving average in terms of yields. You have that sort of down slope in terms of the TLT. So, you know where I stand. I think the TLT trades lower from here. Yeah. And I mean, you see it just from a technical perspective. You see a series of lower highs, a series of lower lows. Um, you know, we're not seeing like a lot of violent price action even. You know, it maybe 10 basis points is a lot. We saw, you know, a decline of that over the last couple trading days or or whatever. But, you know, I think there is playing out a scenario where maybe yields kind of move slower because you have incrementally better news and then everyone's kind of not so freaked out about the tweets and this and that or whatever. I I just look at the cadence of the communication that we're getting from Trump and it's just it goes back to and you know whether you want to use a goofy name like Taco or whatever like it goes both ways, okay? Because, you know, the Republicans have a a tax bill and they're calling it a big beautiful bill. And on the flip side of that, if you have traders coming up with a stupid acronym, taco, it, you know, this is where we are right now, people, you know, some of the folks on the line will say we're in a clown world. Well, we kind of are, right? So, however you want to categorize it, you know, I just look at a tweet like that from the president and I say there's no there there. You know what I mean? It kind of speaks to the point that you were saying that expectations were not high into it, right? And so all you got to do is flatter the guy a little bit and said, \"Oh, well, you know, the first lady and I were just invited to go to Beijing, so we're gonna It doesn't matter. We're not going to get anything that is material.\" Which goes back to the UK, the UK trade deal. They have a surplus with I mean like when you think about it, like we're in good place with the UK. We haven't heard anything from the EU. We haven't heard anything from Canada. We haven't heard anything from Mexico. And we're certainly not going to hear anything material from China. So if you think that a status quo with a 10% across the board tariff around the world is good, maybe that is a good scenario. I don't know. But you're not seeing it reflect in some of the growth data that we're seeing around the world. The other thing I'll say is that the EU, they just said they're done cutting. You you know what I mean? So at what point do rate cuts over here help our economy? I'm not so sure if a September 25 basis point cut helps a whole heck of a lot. Yeah, I think this was their eighth cut in a row. Um, and obviously when people here see that, they're like, you know, why aren't we cutting here? Again, you know, you know, my view. By the way, I think everybody remembers what happened in September when we cut. Uh, yields actually went higher on the back of that and they're still higher than they were in September of last year. So, there there's a lot of things going on, but right now, I mean, what we're focused on is the broader market. The broader market seemingly likes what it's hearing on this front. And you have an S&P that's now up almost, you know, 4/10en of 1%. NASDAQ's up, you know, almost 3/4 of a percent. It's like none of this stuff ever happened. And you hear the frustration in my voice because again, all the concerns I have are founded, but in terms of the market, they're clearly unfounded. And you know, that's when this game gets really difficult. Yeah. And I think it's also worth noting, it goes back to uh Rosie, it goes back to the data that uh Mario just showed us. Also, let's look at the banks. We haven't talked about the banks in a little bit here. So, let's start with the regional banks. And I know this is one where, you know, this was the kind of source of some problems in early 2023. We saw some liquidity there. I think a lot of folks thought that that, you know, uh, Silicon Valley Bank, um, the regional banking crisis might kind of broaden out a little bit. It didn't, but look at where this index is relative to where it was post election last year, right? It filled in that gap really quickly, that one day gap after, you know, uh, Trump's, um, election here. And look at the series of kind of lower highs here. And you saw obviously the bottom fall out getting to those 52- week lows during that April kind of um you know uh bloodbath in the S&P 500. But we saw the gap again after we saw a push out of the China trend and look at it filled in that gap. You see the 200 day moving average. You see that kind of green support line that we kind of gave. Maybe it's important, maybe it's not. But it really feels heavy right here, guy. And and this is going to look very similar to the uh small cap index and it yeah I agree with you and there's a reason for that because these medium these small and medium-sized banks are extraordinarily economically sensitive and they are reliant upon the local businesses in the regions that they operate in and I think this is my view and I think the data backs it up. I mean things are slowing down. So it all makes sense in terms of in terms of small and regional banks and it all makes sense in terms of the small caps. What doesn't make sense necessarily is the sort of continued strength in the broader market and maybe the strength in some of these banks. I mean, we flagged Wells Fargo yesterday. Everybody got all excited about Wells Fargo. I'm going to look and see where it is right now. But, you know, I was a big believer like that was sort of a selling news event the other night when that came out in the middle of our show. And at least right now, it looks like it might have been. I mean, you're talking about Wells Fargo, which was within an earshot of not a 52- week high, Dan, but an all-time high, I think, that we made back in February. I think it was north of 80 bucks. So, you know, there's a lot to be excited about, but I think a lot of these big banks and regional banks are in for some tough sledding. Yeah. So, just looking at the BKX, right? So, that's the larger cap banks here. Um, this doesn't look good either. I mean, you know, again, we have an S&P that's, you know, 2 3%, you know, um, away from its all-time high as we just talked about Mario's data about, you know, the the the I guess the rally broadening out a little bit. So, banks really aren't participating that much. Um, so let's keep an eye on that. Let's keep an eye on the BKX if it's able to kind of hold this kind of 200 day moving average, which is below that uptrend that had been in place. So, we just looked at the S&P uptrend which is still intact, but let's see if we start seeing banks leading to the downside. Now, another one, this is the last what I would say important earnings, you know, report across the S&P 500 is coming very late in the cycle. It's coming a week after what we heard from Nvidia. Um, this would be Broadcom, right? So, look at this. It was 45% off its December highs. You and I have talked about that fine. But the fact that it's up now 85% off of the lows at a new all-time high heading into this print tonight after the close, a 7% implied move in either direction, that seems really cheap to me, guy. And if you were looking to buy a call, okay, Friday's close, that's tomorrow. Three and a half% in either direction. If you're looking to buy a put, three and a half% to the downside, right? So three and a half% potential upside, three and a half% downside. I mean, I don't know how you're not looking lower here, man, after this sort of run because to me, I don't know what the hell they're going to be able to say that's going to support the rally that we have had over the last month and a half. Well, remember what they said in December, and that didn't make a lot of sense. And that proved to be correct in the subsequent move into April. And now, to your point, this is a much different setup than we had in December of last year when the stock was still reasonable on valuation. There's this little couple little well there's one little gap in the chart probably comes in somewhere around 215 220 and you know I think you see a gap fill and then you want to play all the way back down to the 200 day moving average which probably comes in around 195 but to your point look could they say something to get some market jazz absolutely I mean I'm hardressed though to figure out what that's going to be given that run that we've seen over the last now two months it's it's and a word historic I mean this is now joined the trillion dollar club And I was watching one of the Decos on one of the shows on CNBC yesterday and they were talking about, you know, in Avago Broadcom being part of the now I hate to say it again for the second time, the Magnificent 7 and you actually brought that up months ago. Yeah, we call it the Faithful Eight guy back. Well, we you know you you know you just called it the mag seven and you add one more and it's the fate it's the fateful eight and you know like that moniker which I obviously did coin back in December when this thing had that 40% two-day rally. I mean just think of that. We're just talking about an 85% rally in the last six or seven weeks off of the lows. In two days it gained 40 uh% or so. So here we are. It took a little bit longer this time around. It is more than a trillion dollar market cap. And you know, the excitement here reminds us a little bit about the excitement in Nvidia going back two years or something like that. So again, um your guess is as good as mine what they say to keep this going. But if I could spend $10, okay, if I was long this stock, $10 for the tomorrow expiration 265. I'm looking at it right here, the 265 put and you have the stock trading at 264. So, it's already a dollar in the money and your break even again, like we said, is down 3% or so. That makes some sense to me. And you know what? I might be looking at that into the close today because I don't like binary trades generally using options in around earnings, but this one looks attractive, guy. It sticks out like like a sore thumb as they say. So, I'm sort of with you. And look, they are capable of saying just about anything in this environment to get people uh to get people excited or to continue the excitement. But yeah, you know, we we're going to find out in a few hours what that is. I don't think it can happen. Real quick, we got a question about silver. It's from Ben M141 if you want to throw that up. And it's about PAS. So, if you go back and look at a chart, by the way, we've talked about silver here, but we're right at levels that we last saw, I want to say, in April of 2022 in terms of uh panamerican silver. It's a name that people play in the silver market. If you go longer term, you'll see exactly what I'm looking at. So, I think you've been longing this stock. I I think you got to start thinking about taking some profits and you can do the horizontal line from those low and you know and look to to fight another day. You know these the silver market the fits and starts are historic. Uh I think we're setting up for another one. I I believe in the story but it doesn't move in a straight line. So take profits here in my opinion in PAS. Yeah. If you want a deeper dive into the silver trade um our good friend Peter Bookvar obliquely adviserss he also writes the book report. He was on the on the tape podcast with Danny Moses that dropped on Wednesday. They talk gold, they talk silver. It was a great conversation. Check it out. Go to their favorite podcast store wherever you get your podcast. Um, and go follow the On the Tape podcast. Also, go to their YouTube page. Um, and uh, Danny's doing a lot of great work there and having a lot of great uh, conversations one-on-one um, each week. So, go follow that. Um, guy Lululemon, I know you wear the Lulu's. Um, this is something that, um, you know, you wear them when you're working out. You wear those pants when you're just out and about around town. I don't wear the pants, but you do have the shorts, right? The boxer short. The boxer briefs. Absolutely. Okay. So, when they reported um, three months ago, you see that gap, right? This is one of those companies where um, I get it. It became something of uh, you know, um, people love the stuff and the stock kept on moving higher and the valuation became, you know, something that people could point at. um every other quarter it looks like they have a gap higher, they have a gap lower. You know, they're at consumer kind of whims as it relates to fashion. Um but here we are. We filled in that earnings gap. We're above that 200 day moving average, right? The earnings gap from three months ago. Um expectations for a 9% move in either direction. I can't imagine like that's crazy to me that that implied move is greater than that um of Broadcoms and maybe say it's the law of large numbers as it relates to Broadcom. But thoughts here because this is wrapped up a little bit into discretionary. It's wrapped up into some trade war sort of stuff and you know h how are you thinking about this in let's look at a chart. So if you go back to the December high which by the way I think December of 2023 I think was the all-time high in this stock. So if you go longer term chart and draw a downtrend you will see that we're pretty much right up against. So, draw that downtrend from 2023 and you'll see what I'm looking at. I mean, actually, we're not up against it. We still have a little bit of room to the upside. Uh, the double bottoms below, and we've talked about that. That's actually something to watch as well. So, I actually think there's a chance that this thing surprises to the upside and you trade up to the third point of this downtrend line that's been in place for the last, I don't know, three years or so, if that makes sense. Yeah. Why why wouldn't you use a word you know that word impaling you you use as it relates to there you go so there you go Steven is just impaling he's doing he's not impaling himself so what is that level so three let me call it 380ish to the upside yeah I think there's a chance trade up there and and make the third point of a downtrend line that's a 10%ish move right and the idea of kind of getting it all in one fell swoop and this goes back to what we were just talking about long premium directional especially into events, you have implied volatility, the price of options pumped up, right? So, let's just say you wanted to kind of buy the move or you wanted to kind of target the move to the upside. You know, if you have a 9% move, if you buy the at the money call, again, this is a 4 and a half% move. You have to realize by tomorrow's close. It's a tough way to trade options, people. And we obviously would not suggest buying the move. That would be the call premium and the put premium. That would be the at the money. Check the side. Yeah. Well, there you go. Um, all right. I just want to before we kind of finish this conversation on discretionary, let's pull up the Nike chart here, guy. And, and this is one where, you know, you see that downtrend, you see that huge gap from last summer. Um, you see a series of lower highs, lower lows. Um, you had that gap on the last quarter here. We've kind of moved higher. We've almost filled in that gap. We've been consolidating there. You see the 200 day moving average at like 73 bucks or so. And it doesn't have to be today, tomorrow, the next thing. Would you be more inclined to play for a move towards that 200 day moving average or you think this thing is going back towards its prior lows? Maybe they can pull up a 5-year chart. You see where that is relative to the co? Yeah, even if you go a little bit longer. I mean, we actually thought it could get down to the sort of CO lows and it got I think it got close if I'm not mistaken. But I will I will answer your question and say you can play it for a bounce here. You know, I think enough damage has been done and the expectations are low enough to think that you could potentially have a bounce in this name. So again, like Lululemon, listen, I don't think these stocks are off to the moon, but I definitely think they're tradable here on the long side for a bounce. All right, last thing. Uh Visa upgraded at Mazun. Yeah, this is this is an interesting one. All-time highs. They've been neutral for the thing for a while. I I just hate these sorts. I feel bad for some of these analysts sometimes. I don't feel bad for this guy right here because if you were neutral this whole way and you've had this sort of move. Let's pull up the chart for a second here. Um, you know, do you kind of just pull the rip cord here guy and get bullish? You know, I mean, this is a tough one, man. And the valuation I know you're going to hit and everything like that. I just don't like these sorts of calls. We're highlighting it because I think it's interesting after the market rally that we had um and the relative outperformance here. So, thoughts? Well, it made a new all-time high today, Visa. I think 371. You know, I think at a certain point analysts get the, you know, they feel the same thing that traders do when you're on the wrong side for a period of time. At a certain point, you just say uncle and traders do it in terms of stopping out and analysts do it in terms of upgrading names they're neutral or even worse than neutral on. And it it happens to everybody. So, and I think that's what probably happened here. And I think the bet is that look, it's been lower left, upper right for so long that let's just try to catch this last little piece of the move. And and maybe they will. But you just said it. I mean valuation has always been a concern around this. By the way, Visa and Mastercard are names that we have collectively liked for a long time. The only concern is around valuation. It's not necessarily as economically sensitive as people think because it's just a transaction processing company and again people trying to fight inflation, they're doing it with their plastic and they don't take credit risk. So, it makes sense on that metric, but I think your point is well taken. You don't you hate these types of upgrades because it's so late in the cycle. Yeah. Um last thing, I swear it's last thing. Um you know, we get inspiration from all different sorts of places. Um I have the Wall Street Journal web page up right now, guy, and this is kind of interesting. I'm staring at this advertisement, which you probably don't see if you have it up, but I put the screenshot into our chat. This is Rathon connecting our world. Is that RTN or RTX now? Actually used to be RTN. Okay. Yes, it did. So, let's pull the RTX chart up. While while um we have Oh, there you go. So, look at that advertisement staring me in the face. So, what do I do? I go to my faxet machine and I pull up the stock here. I know this is one you've liked the defense names. They had a lot of volatility in April. That's kind of a whole host of things going on there, whether it's trade and, you know, all that sort of stuff and defense spending as it relates to China or Ukraine. And um look at that thing, man. You know, you could say that was in a bit of a base here. Um, but now that thing is back to those 52- week and all-time highs and it's alltime highs. I'm gonna ask Stephen to do something here and I'm not trying to tee you up at all, but if you can overlay this long this chart with a Lockheed Martin chart and then go longterm. They were on basically on par with each other until right around the election and then Lheed Martin took a nose dive like Yeah, that's right. Look at you, Stephen. See, see what I'm looking at there, Dan? They decoupled in a pretty major way and now Rathon is off to the races. So you could be putting in sort of a rounding little bottom here in Loheed Martin, but I think Rathon continues to do it do the dance. I mean it's just a great American company and you know they've acquired some companies along the way. So they went from Rathon to RTX Corp. I think they acquired Pratt and Whitney and uh Rockwell Collins I think if I'm not mistaken. So that's off the top of my head. So I still like RTX here for sure. All right, pull up LMT just on its own because this is um really really interesting that you bring up Kai the the disconnect or the the one dog goes one way, the other goes. So So Rathon's trading at 23 times this year. Lockheed is trading at 17 times. You look at the move much cheaper. You look at it's it you'll look at the move from those recent 52- week highs. Now make it a five-year chart. This is where it really sticks out to me. Okay, so so look at that. It had that massive breakout. It was a runaway breakout, then it gave it all back. It came back to that 200 day moving average. It's consolidating in and around here. Um, is there like a is there a trade? Is there like I know I think so. On the long side, this was the Ellen Mike Clam last year and I looked like a genius until, you know, later in the year when it cascaded lower. But on valuation alone, I like it. And I think you know what hurt Lockheed and a lot of companies was the whole Doge thing and the fact that there was a chance when you know defense spending was to take a look at and Lockheed was probably no pun intended in the crosshairs of that. I mean front and center actually and they paid the price but you just brought up valuation and you know it's still one of the great companies out there. So yeah I think you can play Lockheed. You you don't have to sell Rathon to own Lockheed. I think you can own both of them. Yeah that that's an interesting one though. Paris trade might be interesting also, but I I hear what you are saying. All right. Should we get out of here? Uh, why not? I We have a big live show tonight, which is going to be fun. I think some of the people Well, maybe not because maybe they're in New York already and not watching this show, but they're going to be with us tonight. As you mentioned, Mario will be there all knotted up. I look forward to that. I don't know. Hope I'm about to sit down with Demo. That of course is Danny Moses. That will drop tomorrow. That's always worth the price of admission. My sense is he'll even talk about the Belmont Stakes which take place at uh Saratoga Racetrack this year. They're back at Belmont I believe next year. We have a lot to discuss. So there you go. So that is in the risk reversal podcast feed. So get check that out, Guy and Danny. That's going to drop tomorrow morning. Um you know, leave a review. That's how people find it with your friends. All that smash the out of the like button. Didn't we used to say that? Yeah, you can do that too. Um, you know, however you like to kind of hit that like button. So, um, check that out. Great week for everybody. Non-farm payrolls tomorrow morning. It will be interesting to see how the market reacts to a number that at least investors are kind of getting teed up to kind of see some weakness there. So, maybe it goes the opposite way, guy. If we see some weakness and weakness might signal greater chance of rate cuts and you tell me if that's good for the markets. I don't know. Well, we're we're going to find out, baby. as they say. All right, man. We'll see you uh all tomorrow morning on the Risk Riversal podcast, or you can listen to that uh there. And we'll see you all Monday at 11 a.m. for the market call. Thanks so much. [Applause] [Music]"
