  "transcript": "back to Market on Close. It's time for the big picture. For that, we're going to bring in our next guest. It's going to be Nathan Peterson, director of derivatives at Schwab Center for Financial Research. Good to talk to you again, Nate. You know, things change from when we spoke earlier today. Equity markets were all positive. Now we're all negative. Give me your take here on what you've seen today in a pretty highly volatile session. Yeah yeah no doubt Tom you know back half of this day got a little bit interesting. You know, even before the Tesla news came out where the tweets were going back and forth and the stock really rolled over, we had the circle IPO. And what I noticed around that time as well is when it launched for trading, I was seeing a lot of selling in Bitcoin and those crypto related type stocks, and I put Tesla and Bitcoin within that growth high beta complex. So you include your core weaves, Palantir and Nvidia's. Your AI plays your your nuclear play. Small nuclear reactor plays. You know, all of that that that cohort that has really, honestly led us out of the depths of the April selloff. I think there was some market mechanics as Tesla rolled over, because it's in so many funds that likely had some impact in terms of triggering some algorithmic trading. And then Tom, like we talked about, this market has just been, you know, melt higher regardless of whatever is happening on trade or whether we get soft economic data like we have over the past 30 hours. So I think it was the culmination of all that. Look, we're only down half a percent on the S&P 500, but we're so used to the melt up that feels a little bit unusual today. Yeah. Yeah. You get into that stance where you expect a little grind up every day and then you get a day like today where some individual stock news comes in, kind of throws a monkey wrench into things. But I think everybody is starting to get focused on that jobs report tomorrow, Nate. And I think it's going to be important. But at the same time, if it's a good number, maybe that's good for equities. If it's a bad number, maybe rates start to go down and it's actually a positive for equities. So there could be some of that going into the mix tomorrow right. Yeah there certainly could I think that you know if the Bulls could have it their way they would love for the economy to be strong and for jobs to be plentiful and for wages to be going up and for inflation to be heading the other way and for the fed to be on their side. Now, maybe I'm stating the obvious. I guess my point is, is that they would rather see good news is good news rather than good news is bad news for the fed. I think the estimates are around 125 K and unemployment rate 4.2%. I say let's keep an eye on that. The JOLTS data was healthy. The initial weekly claims the high water mark was 250 K from last October. We hit 247 this week after an elevated print the prior week, so we got to see some trends there. And then at the end of the day, even if we do get some slack in the labor market, I think the question is, is that just a normal function of companies looking to save, perhaps save some money, perhaps bring in some AI into their business? And it's not. It's just more of an efficient move rather than something that is signaling economic weakness. So, Tom, I think the bottom line is, you know, in terms of the risk to the market, we talked about it on fast market. But yes, if yields were to begin to go up and then make new cycle highs, that would be bad. Trade is probably the most likely. It's not just China. We didn't get a lot of details that they had a phone call, but that they're going to meet soon at an undisclosed location. That's really all we know. But the EU is as well. The EU is not happy about the aluminum and steel tariffs coming up. So that remains an issue on the economic front though. I think we just need multiple months of evidence that, hey, something is shifting in the economy, perhaps as a result of tariffs or supply constraints because of, you know, the tariff related supply constraints, something like that, but relatively buoyant, I'd say, in the face of a lot of potential negatives. Yep. Plenty to digest on that. Non-farm payrolls and Broadcom earnings after the close. Don't forget about that. All right great"
