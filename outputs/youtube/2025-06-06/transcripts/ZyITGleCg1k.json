  "title": "TRADER'S GRIT: Overcoming Setbacks with Scalping and Focus",
  "transcript": "What would you say was the aha moment then by 2024? You just get sick of losing. I guess I think we all do for sure, but there had to be some some kind of was it a change in technique or a change in risk management. It's mostly just discipline. You know, I there's quite a few accounts that I built up pretty good size over this that winter 23 into 24 and early spring. You know, there was a couple of Apex accounts that I traded flawlessly for a month, month or longer and built the balances up to $70,000 or something and, you know, took five payouts from the same account and then blew it, you know, and you blow big balances like that. Obviously, it takes a mental screen, but it's I tried to look at it as obviously I can do this. It's the losing side of it that you need to work on. So that's what I tried to focus on is not letting my losses overtake me. But it still happens to the best of us. Happened to me today. So out of curiosity, do you trade from the tractor then? I I like how you're multitasking here, doing a whole interview while you're plowing. Is that how you trade as well? Uh not very often. I try not to because I'm much more much more loose with uh with stop losses and stuff. I'm sitting in a tractor because, you know, I pull my phone out and try to move a stop loss. It takes a little more time than clicking a mouse, you know. Yeah. So, yeah, I try not to. That How would you describe your trading style? Are you more scalping or with the profit accounts? Uh, definitely more scalping because again, that's what I found works for Apex is taking quick profits because then you don't have to worry about the trailing draw down as much. Sure. Uh, so like for example with Apex, I always run a a fivepoint profit and a 10-point stop is my my go-to ATM on Ninja Trader. And I'll often move the profit up and I will move the stop up if I'm in good profit, but I do not move the stop down. That's a no no, you know. Um, but the way I look at it is if you're going to if you're going to tilt and you're going to blow an account, it doesn't matter if you have 5,000 draw down or 2,000 draw down, you're going to blow it because something snapped in us and we just have no uh no rhyme or reason to our entries and stuff like that. So, Got it. What do you what what assets do you typically trade? Uh, only NQ. Only NQ. So, just one or one or two NQ contracts or how how do you size? Yeah, one to one to three generally. Um Uhuh. Again, once you start losing, it's pretty easy to jump to five and and uh that's recipe for disaster generally."
