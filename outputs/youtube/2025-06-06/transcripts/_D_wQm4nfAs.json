  "transcript": "There's the closing bell on Wall Street and now it is market domination overtime. Jared Blicker going to be along to get us up to speed on the action from today's session. I'll start with the major averages here. The Dow finishing lower by about 100 points, call it 108 right now, about a third of 1%, but you saw kind of the unusual activity throughout the day. We got the news that President Trump had spoken to President Xi of China and he described it as a constructive conversation. So, we'll see where that goes from here. Uh, but the market's not that encouraged by that. We also had jobless claims this morning that came in a little worse than estimated. And we've got the uh BLS, the job support coming from the labor department tomorrow morning. The S&P 500 finishing down by about a half of 1% really fading throughout the day here. But that similar sort of uh what I called a bouncing ball earlier kind of vibe. Uh NASDAQ composite down about 8/10 of 1% and seeing similar action. Jared, I don't know if bouncing ball is like a technical charting term. That's what it looked like to me today. Yeah, call it a sine wave, call it whatever. Um you know, I was I was following this this mudslinging by Trump and Elon Musk here. We'll get to Tesla in a second, but first, yeah, the indices closed down a little bit. S&P 500 volatility has really shrunk over the last week. So only with a 1 half percent loss. This is the worst day in about a week, maybe a little bit longer. Nothing to write home about. Uh I'll take a look at the VIX here real quickly. That's still under the 20 levels. So nothing too bad there. And we had yields ticking down initially today. And it looks like kind of a mixed picture with respect to the 10-year and the 30-year. So the 10ear down three basis points. 30-year just about break even. Let's get to the sector action and then we can here we go. Consumer communication services rather that was the only sector in the green up about 210 of a percent. Consumer discretionary guess who's in there Tesla that was down 2 and a.5%. Then consumer staples the other consumer st sector that was down nearly 1%. I'll also mention materials down half a percent also underperforming the S&P 500. Now let's get to the show in the NASDAQ 100. I will punch up Tesla here down 14.26%. 26%. I believe this is going to be the worst market cap loss ever for Tesla. You'd have to go back to uh September of 2021 to see a second worst date. And this is going to be over 140 billion by my calculations. We'll have to see how things finally net out at the uh in just a few minutes here. But Tesla, let's get the year to date so we can put this in context. Had a nice rally going and uh just gave a lot of it back in the afternoon with the back and forth between Trump and Elon Musk. And we're seeing a little bit more red than green on the screen. Uh especially with respect to the mega caps. Nvidia down 1.3%, Apple down 1%, and some of the other stands out. In the upper right, we got Palunteer down 8% and Costco down 4%. So, lots going on in the NASDAQ 100. A little bit less or fewer fireworks in the Dow. And here we see some standouts. Goldman Sachs up more than 1%. So is Salesforce kind of in the middle of your screen. Uh but uh more red than green for the Dow as well. So a little bit of a setback today in the majors and some of their components. Back to you Josh. Thank you Jared. Well, US stocks wipe out gains on Thursday amid the escalating tensions between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Investors also keep an eye on trade talk developments between Trump and China's Xi Jinping. For more on the market action, we're bringing back in here Fed Watch Advisors founder and CIO. That would be Ben Emmens. Ben, great to see you again on set. Good to be here. So, so let me ask you, I want to touch on what Jared just did there, which was obviously this this public brawl that has broken out Ben between President Trump and Musk. It has gone public and personal. It's gotten very heated. The issue, Ben, or at least one issue would be the big beautiful bill, right? Trump's budget bill. Musk doesn't think it's so big and beautiful, he wants to kill it. Um, I'm trying to I want to get your take on how you think market participants should be thinking about that budget bill because you you wrote in your Substack something interesting here, Ben. You said that the debt load we're dealing with here. You called it for for investors the lurking abominable snowman. What did you mean by that? Yeah. So, one one I was inspired by the abominal like it's in because that's what he was Musk was talking about. But this idea that it is a creature, right? It's like a the debt is a is a kind of a lurking creature and has an issue with being sustainable. You know, we're not growing fast enough to pay off our debt in the future. And that's obviously we can print the dollars and we have the reserve currency and that keeps it together. And that's why we haven't had a debt crisis like we saw in Europe. But nonetheless, it's unsustainable debt load. And if you then think about the criticism that is now getting from in this case Elon Musk and some of the Senate too, there's a sentiment building around this debt. Ran Paul, Ron Johnson. Y so they're all kind of looking at this like are we really going to add another four or five trillion of debt to what we already have and and as the cruise at that with more interest payments is it really going to help our economy? So some doubts about it. The market however said like well if you're going to cut back one way or the other then yield should be going down. That's what happened in the 2011 debt seating issue for example will not happen this time that big that much but it could at least be some sort of spending reduction built into this final bill that the market will tell you okay it probably is not going to maybe that much debt being added to this this total bill than what we initially got. So it takes a little bit of pressure off the the longer of the yield curve which has been pricing in this debt load as an unsustainable snowman. I mean, but it's still going to be a lot and it's still going to be unsustainable, right? In other words, like is there a it's interesting that you do think that it will be smaller spending and smaller um additions to the deficit in the eventual bill, but is there sort of a magic number that it has to combine come down by in order for yields to come down? So that's a really difficult question Julie because people are trying to calculate it like what is sort of the debt to GDP ratio that if you have growth say at 3% that things don't change anymore and then that should actually stabilize not only the debt but also ultimately interest rates and you know years ago you had Ken Ken Rogoff and K Reinard writing about it like 90% that's the GDP ratio that's sort of the threshold well we're well above that now right so and and yields have actually not really become 10% or 20%, we're still sub 5%. Because we have the reserve currency, we got the Federal Reserve with this big balance sheet. We got a lot of money market funds here, a lot of cash that keep buying treasuries. We got banks who do that, too. So, I'm not sure if there's a magic number, but it is about like we got to do something about these long-term liabilities. that's obviously now creeping really in the mind of lawmakers that we got to a point where it just got too far and and we cannot continue on this road or we will face some kind of a debt crisis however it will play out. So I think the market's sort of sitting here that yes if you're not doing anything about it then we will add more incremental risk premium to these treasuries and then that's that's the fraction. Let me ask you another theme today, Ben. And the market actually advanced earlier in the day on this is when we learned Trump and G had a phone call and Trump characterize it. It says it was a good talk said something effective. We straightened it out. I don't what exactly they straightened out. The details we we don't know, Ben. Um but I am curious when you try to size up the US and China right here, who do you think and who do you think the market thinks has the leverage there? Yeah, it's it looks a lot like the China has the Why do you say that? Well, the critical minerals that we really need for auto production. That's where the sticking point was and it really looked like that we had to reach out to China to get this goal going and get a better understanding to move it move the talks forward. Now, whether they actually result into an agreement, that's all to be seen. So there was a little bit relief on that call at least on that news but it's China has the upper hand here and and the market still pricing it like this is going to be more deescalation in order to get that issue resolved is quite technical. China wants to see lower tariffs and different barriers and as much as we try and negotiate on China bring your barriers down so we can start selling finally in China China more more stuff that we that we produce that's still to be seen. So I think the market's sort of sitting here. It's not going to escalate anymore. It's going to potentially be deescalating and that's only a positive. I guess we're just going to continue with this rally ultimately. That's why the draw downs in the market become so so much smaller on days when you had these negative headlines about trade. The market's really implying like yeah this is a situation where as much as we surpass maybe even the deadline in July or August, not too much of risk. So it sounds like you're pretty bullish, Ben, between that risk receding and if you think yields are going to not, you know, go back up from here really, at least not for the, let's say, the debt dynamic issue. Got it. But for the economy itself, it could because the the irony here is that as we do deescalate with this trade war and the stock market continues to rise and financial conditions get looser, the economy has more breathing room, yield should go a little bit higher from here. So you could still see the 10ear test 5% not impossible but not for the debt dynamic. It's really for the relief on on the trade board right and then maybe that wouldn't be a problem for stocks if it's going up for that reason right the good news good news idea that that I think is what the market's been in that rhythm for now it hasn't paid to this budget bill that way like oh gosh we got bad news on that and therefore the market goes down because you know we can't get this together get all the uncertainty on that. Yeah. All right thanks Ben good to see you thanks for coming in. Thank you. All right, let's get to Lululemon earnings. So, crossing the wire, the shares down a quick 13% here. That looks to be has to do with the company's revenue forecast for the second quarter. So, I'll tell you that first. Net revenue for the second quarter seen by the company at 2.54 to2.56 billion. Analysts on average had estimated $2.57 billion. It also looks like uh that the company's forecast for the full year for net revenue leaves it room to miss estimates. For the first quarter, earnings per share met estimates $260. And in the first quarter, net revenue at $2.37 billion. Comparable sales, which we always look at for this company as well, they were up 1% in the first quarter. America's comparable sales down 2%. International up by 6%. So, um, seeing a little bit of weakness here in in the US and the Americas, which is their biggest market. And you know, this stock, Julie, it was already down about 12% year to date heading to this print, and now you're down another quick 12 or 13% here, at least initially in the after hours. I I do see um the CEO, that would be Calvin McDonald, trying to sound an optimistic tone here. uh McDonald talking about uh in the first quarter achieving growth across channels and categories and markets um including the US. He calls out um he talks about guests responding well to product innovations and newness and brand activations does characterize the macro as uh dynamic is how he puts it. Um I also want to call out as I look down here to the increase in net revenue um or I should say the comparable sales let's go there for China which has also been a big market for them. Um so it looks like the China change was 7% a 7% increase. If you take out the effect of foreign exchange you get an 8% gain. So still seeing that sort of relative strength in China relative to the rest of the world on a net revenue basis. China's revenues were up 21% or 22% in constant currency. So, that's something I know that investors have been watching. Let's get more reaction now to Lululemon earnings. For that, we bring in David Schwarz, senior equity analyst at Morning Star. David, it's good to see you. Um, what is going on with Lululemon, particularly in the Americas? Is this a competition issue? Is this a merchandise mix issue? Why do you think we are not seeing better performance in their comps in the Americas? I think it's both of those things. Uh we have seen over the last few quarters uh that competition has had some impact on Lululemon which is unusual because Lululemon historically has always been able to overcome competition. It's really nothing new in this industry. Llemon has all has always faced imitators and contenders. uh but we have seen some companies like Alo Yoga and Vari uh to name two that have that have done very well in the um the upscale women's athleisure space and that has affected Lullemon to some degree. Uh we also have seen a situation which Lullemon has kind of struggled to get the right products into its stores. Uh the company um had a change last year and its design team uh their lead designer uh Son Cho left to become president of Vans and that that did affect Lululemon I think for some time and there has been a reorganization of that part of the business. I I still think that Lullemon is very strong in in product development. Uh but we haven't seen it quite as much recently. And then also it's just a natural slowing down of Lululemon's business in North America. the company already has stores in all major metropolitan regions in in the US and Canada and so it was almost certainty that it would not be able to post the same kind of growth rates that it had in the past and so that's why it's looking for places like China and Europe uh for a lot of future growth. David, what is this company's tariff exposure and how how are they nav navigating that dynamic? Yeah. So, like just about everybody else in this industry, Lululemon uses a primarily Asi based uh production uh primarily third-party factories. I don't think Lululemon has a lot of direct exposure from China. Uh because like others in this industry, including Nike, a lot of the production in China has shifted to other countries in recent years and also a lot of the production in China is actually designed for Chinese consumers and Lululemon has been opening a lot of stores in China. Uh but Lulleman certainly has exposure to countries like Vietnam and other c and other countries in Southeast Asia uh which have emerged as major sportsware producers in recent years. Uh and it does have high exposure to the US. So uh it it certainly does have exposure to tariffs but uh Lululemon does have pricing power. Its products are generally more expensive than others and so I think it can actually raise prices to offset tar tariffs better than most of their competitors. Um and what about its business in China? Um, I mentioned before that we saw comps there um rise at a faster pace, but that's that's been the case there than in the Americas. Is that business meeting your expectations? And is that momentum going to continue, do you think? I think maybe it has slowed down a little bit because there were times when we were seeing growth rates over 30% in China. Um, Lululemon is opening a lot of stores there. It's still a relatively small business. If you look at competitors like Audi Doss and Nike, they have thousands of stores in China. So, Lululemon could conceivably open many more. Uh it's it's a market though right now that is troubled. uh we've seen some pretty weak results uh from sportsware companies in China recently and apparel companies overall uh because China's economy has not been very strong and that's especially true uh with a high youth unemployment in China and that's affecting companies like Lululemon sale like Lululemon and so um you know we may see a bit of a slowdown there uh but it's still a very high potential market for Lululemon uh its market share right now is still very low and awareness is low and it certainly could be much higher in future years Dave Correct me if I'm wrong, but I I believe you have the equivalent of a hold on this name. Uh so what would you need to see, David, before you were telling clients to get more bullish? Yeah. So before today's report, my fair value estimate was 100 was $315. So it I thought it was maybe a little bit overvalued. Uh now with the stock down in in the aftermarket today, maybe it's a little bit undervalued. Uh I you know, I would like to see the company uh get its growth rate in the Americas back up a little bit. We're never going to see the same kind of double-digit numbers that we saw in the past most likely. Uh but if it could get back into into like the the single, you know, mids singledigit range, that would certainly impress u investors and I think that could potentially uh get the the price uh a little bit higher. But, you know, Lulleman stock price tends to be very volatile. At times, it often gets to be quite expensive. Certainly when it was over $500 a share, I was maybe one of the few people who thought it was really expensive and overpriced. Um, but you know, there are buying opportunities if it continues to to go down. You know, this could be a buying opportunity in Lululemon, I think, because this is still a very strong company with with incredible uh earnings power and cash flow and no debt. So, there's a lot of things to like with this company. David, always great to see you. Appreciate that instant analysis. Thank you. Thanks. Well, Broadcom earnings there just crossed the wire. We're going to get you those results on the other side. Stick around. Much more market domination overtime. That's coming up. Taking a look at Broadcom shares. The company's second quarter results just hitting the wire here. Uh Q2 adjusted EPS comes in at 158. The street was at 156. Revenues 15 billion. Consensus was 14.96 billion. And turning to the guy, Julie, they're seeing they they're calling for it looks like Q3 revenue of about 15.8 billion. Analysts have been looking for 15.72 billion. They at least initially here the stock's down about 2%. Yeah. I mean, keep in mind where we have been for this stock, right? It closed at a record high yesterday and it really has been in many investors minds the other chip AI play besides Nvidia. Broadcom increasingly making um chips, custom uh AI chips for other companies as well. So that's been a big part of their business and it's expected to grow more. Hawk Tan the CEO saying in the statement, \"We expect growth in AI semiconductor revenue to accelerate to $5.1 billion in the third quarter, delivering 10 consecutive quarters of growth as our hypers scale partners continue to invest. So, this is something that investors are still going to look to them for, but um perhaps right now you're not seeing like huge jaw-dropping increases. Perhaps that wouldn't justify the gains that we've seen. Yeah, they're calling for Q3 AI semiconductor revenue here, 5.1 billion. Street was at 4.79 billion. Also, this stock, I mean, keep heading into this point, it was up about 15% this year, was up around nearly 90% over the past 12 months. So expectations high into this one. For more of a closer look, uh Broadcom's second quarter. Let's get to research senior equity analyst. That would be uh Angelo Zeno. Angelo, good to see you. So, uh results are out. Saw a bit of a dip here, at least initially in the after hours. We're down about 2%, Angelo, but give us your your reaction to the print. Yeah, I mean, I think you guys laid out the the numbers really well, Josh. And you know, overall the numbers were essentially in line for the the April quarter and even the the July quarter line. uh July quarter top bottom line I think adjusted IBO was slightly above where we expected but nonetheless I mean um for the most part was in line and and this was really a name that was running really hot into the print and um we had seen a ton of good news over the last two months so a lot of that you know positive news flow was really kind of baked into the stock here I will say this uh you guys alluded to the AI semi numbers I think 4.4 4 billion for the the April quarter and that was essentially in line where expectations were and um to your point the the July quarter guide that 5.1 billion I think is a really um impressive number. It's a notable step up in terms of revenue and um when you kind of just look at like five six quarters ago you know this was a business the AI semi semi-revenue was at a run rate sub10 billion it's now you know based on the July quarter guide you're talking north of a 20 billion run rate. So um hawk had alluded to the the fact that you know the serve devel addressable market was north of 60 to 90 billion here two years out. So um we think there's still a lot of upside to be had on the AI story for Broadcom. Yeah. And it looks like it's going to account for nearly a third of that of that third quarter revenue. How should we think about the rest of the business, Angela? We talk so much now with Broadcom about AI. we kind of forget and with every company that has anything to do with AI, we tend to not talk as much about the stuff that you know the other twothirds of the business. So talk to me about that and how investors should be thinking about that part. Yeah. So I mean this I guess quarter their their AI semi-revenue as far as total semi- sales inlected and is now half their their revenue, right? So that's a good thing. So now the the AI portion will increasingly become a bigger part of that business and help you know continue to drive we think high teams growth for this company here over the next two to three years at the very least. When you kind of think about their other businesses the the strong guide for AI semis essentially means their nonsemi um outlook is probably below where expectations were if you kind of look at the fact that they essentially guided their revenue number in line. So um you you're kind of looking at some of these more cyclical oriented businesses. Um their wireless business clearly more tied to Apple. Um and then you kind of look at you know their their infra their carrier infrastructure business among other kind of their uh other segments looks like it just running below um you know where expectations were but the belief was it was going to be more of a late second half um you know 2025 story. So hopefully we start seeing some momentum on that side of things later this year. But clearly I mean the story the valuation of this stock has nothing to really to do with the the the nonAI piece of the business right it is all about that AI momentum and then when you look at the software business um what they've done with VMware is just absolutely incredible it is you know a huge part of the business when you look at software over 40% of their revenue growing north of 20% on a year-over-year basis and now this is actual you know it's all organic growth when you look at it so um very impressive with what they're doing on um the software side of things and the their ability to really uh expand the margins there. You know, Angelo, for for investors listening right now who want exposure to that mega AI trend and theme, you know, as an analyst who covers the space, these companies so closely, Angelo, would you consider Broadcom a core holding in that theme? We would. Um, you know, we do have a buy recommendation on the stock. It is one of our our favorite semi AI semiplays out there. I will tell you this, our our most recently published target price was $235. It clearly blew through that. Um we'll we'll revisit that target price here overnight. But um I will say this, I mean it it when again you look at the the addressable market opportunity and then you look at this company and more importantly today um it's not necessarily the numbers here. It's what they have to say on this call. It's what they have to say about potential new customer wins. It is what drove the stock the last two quarters after they reported. We'll see what they have to say in terms of new customer momentum. Um recent customer wins when that potentially starts ramping. Um could it be sooner than expected? Um all that is going to be really important to hear on the call um and potentially drive upside here to the shares. But yeah, I mean it is a core name within our AI type of um recommendations out there. But I will say this when you look at it from a valuation perspective today, it is also our most expensive AI semi-name. Angelo Zeno, CFRA, research senior equity analyst. Thank you, sir, as always for your time. All right, thanks for having me. All right, time now for what to watch Friday, June 6. Starting off, of course, with the labor force be getting May's full jobs report in the morning. Economists forecasting job growth to slow compared to April with 126,000 jobs being added to the US economy. Unemployment holding steady at 4.2% signaling no major layoffs or job losses in May. And hourly wages ticking up to 0.3% on a month-over-month basis, suggesting that employers are still competing for those workers. Taking a look at the economy, we'll get some fresh data on the consumer coming out in the afternoon with consumer credit. Economists see a slight dip with that number coming in at10 billion dollars, hinting that Americans could be slowing down their use of credit cards and loans amid a challenging economic landscape for consumers. And finally, Summer Game Fest kicking off in Los Angeles. Major companies and brands from across the industry will be in attendance, including the big three console makers, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo. This is coming as Nintendo did launch its long- aaited Switch to console earlier today. That'll do it for today's market domination over time. Be sure to come back tomorrow at 3 p.m. Eastern for all of your coverage leading up to and after the closing bell. But don't go anywhere. On the other side of the break, it's ask for a trend got you covered with the latest and greatest market moving stories so you can get ahead of the themes affecting your money. Stay tuned."
