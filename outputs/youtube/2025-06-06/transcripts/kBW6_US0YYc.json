  "title": "Trump and Musk tensions rise, Wall Street weighs Trump and Xi call, Circle IPO",
  "transcript": "[Music] Hello and welcome to Market Domination. I'm Julie Hyman. That's Josh Lifton. Live from our New York City headquarters, we are giving you the ultimate investing playbook to help tune out the noise and make the right moves for your money. And here's your headline blitz getting you up to speed one hour before the closing bell rings on Wall Street. The more this goes on, the more desensitized you come to every single bit of information. I think there is definite hope in the market still though that things will there will be deals which is why you can't just be like not participating I think in it. Like there's a chance that some cyclical growth names start to take off. Well, the labor market is certainly quite mixed. We're seeing some mixed uh signals from just pretty much every report out there. So for example, yesterday beige book from the Fed little bit mixed on labor demand ISM services same. Not all gloom and doom though. This morning's initial unemployment claims I tend to look a little more on continuing claims. I do think that we're starting to get a little bit more crack showing in those highfrequency labor numbers. This has been a long awaited IPO. Public market investors really haven't seen another crypto IPO since Coinbase back in 20121. So, fast forward a few years, they're now an S&P 500 company. So, you look at that and having a crypto friendly administration, the legislation you just talked about that's in front of Congress that would really regulate stable coin and legitimize it. These are all tailwinds and, you know, um votes of confidence in the stable coin market. We got one hour to go until the market close. So, let's take a look at the major averages here. I mean, this has been quite a bouncing ball kind of a day here awaiting the jobs report tomorrow morning. That's going to carry a lot of weight for investors. This morning, we got a jobless claims report that came in a little bit worse than is expected, the highest level since October. So, the Dow right now up 56 points. There's a little bit of drama in Washington we're going to get to as well. The S&P the same kind of bouncing ball situation here. It's right now down a tenth of 1% and the NASDAQ is down a third of 1%. Yeah, we had advanced earlier in the day. I mean, when we heard about Trump and G, they had a talk and and the way that Trump discussed it, it was a good talk. He says he said something to the effect of that we we straightened it out. What exactly was straightened? Julieman ex detail specifics. We don't know. Um the economic data I think is interesting that you mentioned too because it's been coming a bit softer. I mean, we were talking yesterday. Yesterday was ADP and ISM services. Today, you mentioned claims this morning, all ahead of that big jobs report. Yeah, that's going to be really important tomorrow. And then there is the drama that's unfolding, which we're going to dig more into in a moment. But first, I just want to look at an intraday chart of one of our most watched stocks on a consistent basis, and that's Tesla. And you see the stock sliding here as the fight between Elon Musk and Donald Trump is intensifying. As I said, we're going to get to it in a moment, but it's interesting to see it have such an effect on the shares. Yeah. I mean, listen, it at the end of the day, this is the president of the United States in one corner and in the other corner you've got Musk, you know, the guy who's worth $400 billion. This is a heavyweight fight that has gotten really personal really quickly. I mean, you knew when Musk goes on social media and says, \"You you Trump, you wouldn't have won without me.\" That was going to get a response. And now it has. And really Trump now elevating that, ratcheting up and threatening Mus government contracts. Yes. Exactly. And then the other big story that we're watching today really closely is that uh circle IPO the shares really surging here. So sold at $31. That was the IPO price. First trade at $69 and they've been halted a bunch of times for volatility. Now above $83. We're going to talk to an executive from the company about what all the excitement is about within crypto around stable coins specifically. Good interview coming up there. All right. Tesla shares hitting session lows here. That is amid as we were just talking about growing tension between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump. Musk first taking aim at the tax bill on X saying to kill the bill. Trump later making remarks in the Oval Office that he is disappointed in Musk bashing that tax bill. And you know, Elon's upset because we took the EV mandate and you know, which was a lot of money for electric vehicles and uh you know, they're having a hard time the electric vehicles and they want us to pay billions of dollars in subsidy and you know I I Elon knew this from the beginning. Mus then making an apparent response to Trump's comments saying in a social media post quote whatever and adding on that either you get a big and ugly bill or slim and beautiful bill and that slim and beautiful is the way. Then President Trump turning to True Social just moments ago saying Elon was wearing thin and that the easiest way to save money is to end must contracts. For more on all of this now the moves. Let's welcome in Al Root Baron's associate editor as well as Yahoo Finances Ben Worshkold. Gentlemen, welcome to you both. Ben, I I will start with you. This has gotten personal very quickly. It feels like Trump there really ratcheting this up. He's threatening Musk government contracts. What do you make of it, Ben? Yeah, it's a really been a really remarkable scene this afternoon with with these the series of Trump comments and and Musk basically live tweeting his response. There's even been a Musk response in the last 15 minutes to to some of Trump's comments. He called Trump a liar, which he feels like a real significant thing to call to call the president of the United States, as well as suggesting he didn't really care about government contracts and noting that if if Elon's government contracts were were abolished, that would that the US government wouldn't be able to reach the space station. So, it shows that this is this is escalated to a in a level incredibly quickly and incredibly personally between these two men um all all afternoon that that started with that Oval Office things. Um, what it hasn't changed, I would argue too, is is a lot of the pol is is the politics around this bill that Musk is going after. What we've seen is this kind of weird split screen here in Washington where this bill is is ratcheting forward and this Musk Trump war is is get is reaching new heights. And Al, I want to bring you in on, you know, what is at stake here and what issue here. Now, on the one hand, it seems that Musk is reportedly upset that the Trump administration pulled its nomination for the head of NASA, which is a guy who was close to Musk, a friend of Musk. There also seems to be an issue, maybe the earlier than anticipation anticipated expiration of those EV tax credits in the bill. Musk says he doesn't care about that. He's all about the principle of spending here. But on the other hand, a recent JP Morgan note said that, you know, Tesla really could stand to lose out on quite a lot of money with those tax cuts expiring at the end of this year, which is the the version that's in the current bill. Yeah, we have to it's it's a good question and it's such chaos, we should maybe take a second to center. So, $7,500 federal tax credit uh that goes away in Trump's one big beautiful bill at the end of the year. That's expected. Nobody is surprised about that. that's been out and and nobody expected that to survive. That affects everyone. The federal government is also challenging California's ability to regulate its own air emissions. That's what generates Tesla's ability to sell zero emission credits. Again, not a direct subsidy. Any company can do it, but Tesla is the one that sells the most EVs. Uh on the SpaceX side, SpaceX does business with the federal government. Tesla doesn't really do business with the federal government. Elon is absolutely right. You cancel those contracts, suddenly you can't get to and from the International Space Station. uh uh SpaceX does about half the global orbital launches uh around the world currently and its leads accelerating. So all of those things go into the mix, but forget all that. The stock is down like 13 14%. It's the worst two-day stretch since 2001. What is really at stake is again sort of brand damage. Tesla's uh ability or Elon Musk's ability to irritate the left, left-leaning buyers that were willing to go green, irritate the right, potentially new EV buyers. So now everybody is is uh on the political spectrum is irritated with Tesla. Uh and that has sales implications. Sales have been very very weak uh in 2025. We all know that. It's well documented. So focus more on what this means for Tesla sales and then and Elon's ability to uh not self I will say that not self-regulate and not do things in the interest of Tesla and his hundreds of thousands of employees because of his remember what he told David Faber his princess bridelike principle of being able to say whatever he wants whenever he wants. I guess although you know listen I'm looking at this stock Al it's now down 14% here but as a Tesla investor you know should I concentrate on what is a big feud right now and I'm not minimizing it I mean we have a feud between two heavyweights right I got the president of United States and I got Elon Musk with an estimated worth of $400 billion do I concentrate on that or do I say listen I got to put that to the side it's a headline grabber it's drama it's social media media and I need to just stay focused on the fundamentals of this company. Yeah, Josh, I mean, we talked about this. The fundamentals of course matter. However, Musk is Tesla and Tesla is Musk. So, whatever impacts Musk impacts Tesla and that's just the way it is. I used to use this as a rule of thumb, right? You know, Toyota's worth $300 billion. Tesla up until yesterday was worth a trillion. Uh you could basically minus Toyota from Tesla to get $700 billion of value for AI. Musk leadership uh the you robots all of that sort of stuff. So in one respect you could say that Tesla valuation is mostly responsible for Elon Musk. So he becomes a fundamental issue. Um so you can't ignore it. So yes we have robo taxis potentially in Austin in June. Uh we have a new lowerric vehicle in the second half of the year. Uh we're looking for a sales rebound. Maybe Elon is playing four-dimensional chess to bring uh Democrats back into the fold, but you still have to care about this just like if you were to care about, you know, margins, uh sales, tax policies, anything else like that. It matters. Um and it matters in Washington, too. And Ben, I want to bring you back in on this because Musk, as he pointed out today, he sees himself as a kingmaker, right? He says he was responsible for Donald Trump winning the election because of his spending on the election. He was responsible, he says, for what happened in Congress as well. And I wonder with his departure from the White House, what his political power is at this point, how he's viewed more broadly in Washington. I mean, he sort of changed the paradigm that a lot of lawmakers now if they want to communicate, they go to X, right? That became more of the norm uh with him there. But what are you hearing in terms of of whether lawmakers are going to listen to him? Yeah. Yeah. What what I can definitely tell you is that here in Washington, a lot of the focus from lawmakers on these tweets are the ones that talk about the next midterm elections. Musk has talked about how how lawmakers who vote against this who voted for this bill should be voted out. He talked in the last hour about a new political party. Um, and this is a guy who's obviously spent hundreds of millions of dollars. He spent $288 million in the last election cycle to elect Donald Trump. And he's talked about lowering his political spending, but he could also talk about redirecting to elsewhere. And so that is the that's the factor that I see changing the politics here in Washington, which which Trump which Musk has not said yet. He's he's ambassadored this and he's he's talked about lawmakers voting for it, but he's he's not talked about spending spending his own money potentially hundreds of millions of dollars to to to change the midterm elections next year. So that's the factor that I think would keep Musk's political power in play clearly as his alliance with Donald Trump phrase. Well, by the time we've finished talking here, maybe there's another uh tweet or true social. I don't know. We'll have to check it out. Al, thank you for your perspective on Tesla. Appreciate it. Anytime. Well, a call between President Trump and Chinese President Xiinping took place Thursday and it restarted previously stalled trade talks between the two nations. Our Ben Worskull still with us for more on that which is you know more of a bigger market story today that that obviously caused some waves in the market earlier. What do we know about the call and what happens next? Ben. Yeah. So what we do know about the call is one the one real concrete thing from the call is the headline here is that trade talks will resume. These were talks that were stalled by by the admissions of both sides. They weren't talking to each other waiting on this call and both sides came out of it saying we're going to meet again. It's at a time to be determined and a place to be determined, but the two sides are going to get together. Secretary Scott Bessant will lead the talks on the US side with two of his colleagues. So that's that's the concrete headline that the markets like this morning. And then there was a few signs without a lot of detail here of some of these some of these current issues being at least kind of lowering the temperature. Rare earth minerals was a big one. Trump talked about how they made progress on their which is which has been the main Trump accusation which is that China is cheating on this by not exporting enough rare earth minerals. China did not reciprocate, did not talk about rare earths in theirs. So, we don't actually know any details about what they're going to do. But on this and other issues like international students, there are signs of at least a thawing. Um, which I don't know that it gets us any closer to a deal, but it does at least suggest that this tariff cause, which which seemed teetering on the brink of collapse a couple days ago, will at least be in place for a while longer while the talks continue. All right, Ben, thank you so much. Appreciate it. Stocks on unsteady ground today. oscillating after news of President Trump's phone chat with Chinese President Xi combined with course with Tesla stockfall. Let's bring in here Andrew Simmon with Morgan Stanley Investment Management. He is managing director and senior portfolio manager. Andrew, welcome to the show. Um I want to start on the economic data we've been getting. Andrew, I was talking with Julie at the top of the show about this. It's it's been softer here. Andrew, know yesterday we it was ADP uh ISM services. You saw claims this morning. I'm just curious as a strategist, you you see these data points, Andrew, this week. what do you make of them and and what it potentially means for the market? Yeah. So, look, I mean, I think it's interesting that the market is not down on the weak data. I'm not a strategist. I'm a portfolio manager. And the question is what's embedded in stock prices? And what's interesting here is first quarter earnings came in very strong. Uh, and in theory, if all else was equal, then earnings estimates for the full year should have gone up significantly. but they didn't because of the expectation that it was going to be weak. And so I think the reason why the stock market is not weaker on these weak economic numbers is there already expectation that earnings are not going to be as good. So the market has already embedded a uh a less rosy outlook and I think that's why the stock market is really not going down uh even though the economic numbers are a little weaker. Now Andrew, um it's Julie here. I know that you are really focused on the future, future earnings growth. What's going to happen next? So what kind of metrics are you looking for in your management? You know, or what kind of criteria are you using in this environment where expectations are kind of low? Well, I think it's a wonderful time to pick stocks because what's happening is we had a lot of companies that beat in the first quarter, but their fullear num substantially, but their fullear numbers were pulled down quite a bit on expectations. So, hard data, good. Wall Street saying no, no, it's going to get bad. And the last time I've been this, the last time that happened in my memory was COVID, which was the expectations is it was going to get very bad. And the reality was that earnings were brought down too much and there was kind of a race into year end to bring earnings uh back up. Obviously, it's different this time, but I think the hard data is very much different than the expectations by Wall Street that's about to happen. And when that happens, Julie, it's a great opportunity to find companies doing better than expected. Speaking of hard data, Andrew, that the jobs report tomorrow morning, how important is that print for the market? Well, I think that's another, you know, uh, metric. I'd be surprised if it's weak. I just, you know, listening to companies, I don't see a big downturn yet. I don't uh I hear the expectations, but when you're on the ground, I don't see it yet. So, uh I would be surprised if it's substantially weak. I don't think I think companies are sitting back and waiting to see what happens, but there really hasn't been a lot of movement yet. Um, zooming out again, and I'm I'm sort of curious about seasonality because I guess there's been sort of a vibe among some investors. You can sort of step back for the summer. the volatility might be muted here. Um, and maybe the worst is behind us in that department. How are you thinking about that? Well, first of all, I do think second quarter is going to surprise on the upside yet again. So, I wouldn't be surprised the market's at an all-time high. But look, the setup is not as good right now as it was in early April. This why? Because the markets just had a 20% rally. the VIX is back down to below 20 and that's a more dangerous time for bad news to surprise and I don't know what it will be but the flip side was in April the market was down 17% the VIX was at 50 and we got incremental good news 90-day tariffs uh pause and the market had a big rally so the setup is not very good right now in terms of if we get a surprise a negative surprise you know the market could pull back. I suspect that probably happens later, you know, we're more vulnerable later in the summer because I do think second quarter earnings are going to be better than expected. Andrew, good to see you. Thanks a lot for joining us. Thank you. We're just getting started here on Market Domination. Coming up, it's the latest edition of our series, Goodbye or Goodbye. We'll take a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best moves for your portfolio. Stick around. Much more market domination still to come. [Music] Federal Reserve Governor Adriana Cougler is doubling down on her support for keeping interest rates steady for now. Yahoo Finance's Jennifer Shawn Burgerer joins us now with more on today's Fed speak. Round it up for us, Jen. Hey, Julie. Yep. Getting a lot of Fed speak today. Members of the Fed warning that the risk of higher inflation from tariffs is more of a focus now than a weakening job market. Fed Governor Adriana Cougler warned today she sees the risk of higher inflation from tariffs and supports holding interest rates steady so long as inflation remains a risk. I see greater upside risks to inflation at this juncture and potential downside risks to employment and output growth down the road. And this leads me to continue to support maintaining the FOMC's policy rate at this current setting if upside risk to inflation remain. Cougler said she doesn't think it's clear that one could look through tariffs and that they'll be a oneshot deal. She's eyeing inflation expectations that could give businesses ammunition to raise prices as well as tariffs on parts used to make final products for whether price increases could prove more permanent. Referencing research from staff at the Fed, she said a 20% tariff on Chinese imports is estimated to add 2/10en of a percentage point to inflation and that since Chinese tariffs are higher than that and have increased on other countries as well, that prices are getting passed through quickly and we could see larger price increases soon. Meanwhile, Kansas City Fed President Jeff Schmid also said today he's very focused on the risk for higher inflation from tariffs, noting that economic theory might suggest that monetary policy should look through a one-time increase in prices, but that quote, \"This is not a signal that we should let down our guard.\" He said the Fed balances its mandate for as the Fed balances its mandate for full employment and price stability. He intends to remain focused on the importance of quote maintaining credibility on inflation. Elsewhere, outgoing Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker said in his last speech before he retires at the end of this month that he too favors holding rates steady in the face of policy uncertainty. He says it's unclear whether inflation from tariffs could prove short-lived. Back to you, Jen. Thanks very much. Let's talk about stable coins. It's a growing corner of crypto drawing attention from both regulators and investors. Many are pegged onetoone to the US dollar, acting like a digital version of cash that lives on the blockchain. Unlike Bitcoin with its volatile swings in either direction, stable coins are designed to do one thing, keep their value stable. And that stability makes them useful not just for crypto traders, but for payments, remittances, even savings. They're also being tested by central banks and fintech companies as a potential foundation for a new era of faster, more efficient global payments. But they're not without risks. Trust hinges on what's backing them, typically cash and US treasuries, and on the credibility of the issuer. Tether and Circle of are two of the biggest companies in the space, both issuing their own stable coins. And as this space grows, stable coins could play a central role in shaping the future of digital money as long as trust, transparency, and regulation can keep up. Well, stable coins in focus today. Circle, issuer of the stable coin USDC, started train today at 69 per share. It's after pricing its initial public offering at 31. For more, we're bringing in Heath Tarbert, president of Circle. Heath, welcome to the show. Congrats on the big day, Heath. You know, the company, as I understand it, it's been around some time. I I think Keith found it around, correct me if I'm wrong, around 12 years ago. So So why go public now, Heath? And what went into that decision? Well, that's exactly right. Circle's been around for a long time, and it's been our long-term goal and aim and part of our strategy to go public. As was said earlier, trust, transparency, and reliability is really key in this industry. And we're the world's largest regulated stable coin issuer. And so, it was only natural that to raise the level of trust, transparency, and governance, we would go public, be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and be held to those high standards. So, that is why we are a public company. But in many ways, this is just the beginning. Um, so talk to us about what's next then. I guess we're seeing huge demand we should say for your shares in today's session. I know it was overs subscribed. The shares are going up quite a lot today. So there's a lot of excitement around this but what is next? And talk to me about um the profit profile of the company, how you guys make money on the stable coin business. Yeah. So, we are we are engaged in building the world's largest and most widely used stable coin network and wherever there is regulation, we are seeking to have the highest level to get the right licenses because we really think that's going to be the differentiator. And so, the more our stable coins are used throughout the world, the the the better it is for our network and the network effects take place. And so, we obviously have the network uh the amount of stable coins that we have in circulation. We have those reserves bas invested in very high quality liquid assets, but we also have a number of tech products and protocols that make us a far better network than some of our competitors out there. Uh, and so those come with fees and and we're continuing to build out those revenue streams as well. But again, when we look at at what we're offering compared to the traditional payment systems, it's not even comparison in terms of the amount and the cost to transfer things over the internet through blockchain protocols. Heath, I'm very curious to get your take on the Genius Act, which is making its way through the halls of power in DC. Heath, I'm just curious what what you all circle make of that legislation. Are you positive on it? Uh you got questions? Are you skeptical? I'm curious to hear your take. Yeah, we're very positive on the legislation. We think it's probably the best piece of stable sound stable coin regulation in the United States that we've seen because in many ways it enshrines the circle way of doing business. We were we had onetoone backing with highquality liquid assets, transparency as well as monthly attestations uh ever before it was required of us. So we set about building again the world's best stable coin in our view and we asked ourselves what characteristics would that have and the characteristics that the Genius Act would enshrine in law is essentially those characteristics that we imposed upon ourselves before anyone told us we had to. So we're very supportive of the legislation. We think it's it's outstanding and the fact that it has broad bipartisan support shows the importance that despite the partisanship that's going on in Washington and elsewhere, this is so important for the country that we move forward. Um, does it also open the door though to more competition? Now, as we mentioned before, um there is Circle and then Tether is sort of the other main stable coin company, but some have reported, including the Wall Street Journal, that some of the nation's largest banks are now talking about teaming up on some kind of stable coin initiative. As we know, there are also central banks that have talked about uh stable coins as well. So, what's that competitive threat look like for Circle? Yes. So, first of all, it doesn't appear that the United States is interested in creating a central bank digital currency. So, private sector stable coins for the US dollar are going to be the path forward. As far as competition goes from the private sector, we welcome it. Right now, the global stock of electronic money is $60 trillion. And Croup uh predicts that within the next few years, the global stock of stable coins will be about three trillion. Right now, we're only at 200 billion between us and the other stable coin issuers are out there. So there's a tremendous opportunity for growth. And in our view, we can compete on all of those things that I mentioned before, trust, transparency, quality, as well as the fact that we're an internet network business that's that's building and has many developers around the world building on top of our own stable coin network. So we're very confident in our ability to compete. But the fact that more people will be coming into the industry will only mean that more people are using stable coins than ever before. Heath, you know, the Trump family, as you know, very interested, Heath, in all things crypto, including stable coin. And I'm just curious how you would all circle think about their participation and their enthusiasm. Is it is it good for adoption, Heath? Is it bad for adoption? It maybe it doesn't matter. What do you think? Again, we welcome competition from all corners. And as far as President Trump, Trump Trump himself, he has been tremendous in his support of the importance of blockchain and the fact that America needs to lead. So he has really shown great leadership as have all of the folks that he's appointed to key regulatory positions. So again, we welcome the competition and we certainly welcome the change in Washington to embrace this technology because every other jurisdiction of major import around the world, including places like the European Union have adopted rules and regulations and embrace this technology. So it's about time that the US also moves forward. Um Heath, what about some of the other things that the Trump family has done within crypto? the memecoin for example. Now, Truth Social is going to have a cash Bitcoin ETF, and there have been quite a number of complaints and allegations of corruption or favoritism linked to that. Given what you're saying to us that, you know, reputation is so important for stable coins in particular, does that sort of tarnish the industry when we see activity like that? Well, the industry is going to have a diverse set of players and the industry itself is really diverse. What Circle is focused on is what you said in the very beginning of the segment, which is not necessarily even crypto. Stable coins in particular are a payment systems innovation. They're a far better, superior, safer, cheaper, and more technology focused sort of advanced way of moving dollars. Uh, and that is our primary focus. And in many ways that transcends the traditional crypto ecosystem. In fact, we've seen in the last year stable coin growth decoupled from traditional digital assets trading. And that tells us that people are using stable coins for all sorts of things that that are ti are not tied to digital assets, but crossber remittances, the ability to have a store of value. And with the Genius Act, uh there'll be many more uses, including in the traditional financial system. Keith, great to have you on the show today and and congrats on the big day again. My pleasure and honor to be here. Coming up, Palanteer shares, they're sinking today. We'll check in on the stock as well as some of the other top trending tickers. Stick around. Much more market domination. [Music] That's silver prices, they are surging to 13-year highs today as uncertainty around President Trump's tariffs continue. For more, we're bringing in Yahoo Finance senior markets reporter Enz Feranz. Yeah, Josh. And we have seen silver really take off uh this week. Take a look right now at where we're looking at silver futures. They're up above $35 per ounce. So, you're looking at 35.82. And year to date, you're looking at silver that's up 20%. There's a few reasons because of this. One is that this is a technical breakout. One analyst saying that this breakout has been brewing for a while and silver attempted to break through the $35 level a couple of times uh in recent months and now it that is happening. Also, you're seeing demand of flows into silverbacked ETFs. Also, some speculation that is going on. Look, silver is an industrial metal as well. So, there are uses for this as far as on the industrial side. It's made it's it's used for so many uh so many so much manufacturing from electronics to uh solar panels. So anytime that you also see any type of supply and demand imbalance you are going to also be seeing um those prices go higher. But there is certainly this broadening demand so to speak beyond gold because silver and gold have a strong correlation. One of course is worth a lot more than the other. But usually when gold moves up or down, you will see that silver also uh moves up or down. And gold right now is up about 30% uh year to date and or 27% year-to date. Silver up 20% year-to- date. So this bodess well for silver bulls out there because that you would see silver going up higher. By the way, take if if you look at the all-time high record for silver, that was $50 a troy ounce back in 2011. So presumably you still have room to go. But of course there are analysts out there that are saying this is a strong move in a a short amount of time. So uh beware of speculation out there in thanks so much. Appreciate it. Thank you. [Music] Taking a look now at our trending tickers. We're focusing on Dollar Tree and Nebius, both rising in share price. Palunteer stock, on the flip side, is sinking. Let's start with Dollar Tree. It's seeing a good day of trading following the company's announcement of a strong first fiscal quarter. Uh the stocks on the rise throughout the day, working to reach pre-wednesday numbers that saw an 8% drop in the stock. Uh the increase, by the way, coming despite warnings that the quarter 2 could be rough for Dollar Tree due to tariff related uncertainty. So dropped 8% yesterday, more than making up for those gains today. And among other things, JP Morgan upgrading the stock to overweight from neutral. Um, and basically it was Matt Boss, who's a pretty influential retail analyst over there, saying that there were some positives within the report. Yeah, I mean, they did tell investors it's Q2 profit looks like could be down as much as 50% from a year ago. So, as it's dealing obviously with these tariff impacts, um, does then expect profit to reacelerate though in the remainder of the year. Uh, saying most of its directly imported products are from China. also uh selling the family dollar division, remember for about a billion dollars that looks like it's on track to close this quarter, but JP Morgan with an upgrade, that doesn't hurt. Yeah, exactly. So, it fell after the earnings, rising after the upgrade, but it also saw some price target increases. So, other analysts obviously thinking here that maybe some of the bad news is priced in. Um JP Morgan's price target going to 111 from 72. Barklay's raising its price target to 95 and Deutsche Bank going to 100 bucks on that stock. All right. Meanwhile, Nebius Group is also seeing some impressive gains today, potentially ending the session on an all-time high for that stock. So, uh, I did see reports here, Julie, Nebius, it looks like they were initiated with a buy rating at a rate research. Cororeweave though gets a new neutral rating. It looks like the analyst preferring Nebius in part on valuation, saying the direction of stocks depending on whether or not investors think there's a shortage of GPUs. Interesting. And, you know, Corewig has gotten a lot of attention obviously since its IPO. It has had huge gains since then. It's been It is down in today's session as we see this note. But guess what? Nebius is no slouch. The stock is up 78% year-to- date. It's up almost 150% over the past 12 months. This stock has been around for a lot longer, though. It went public um more than a decade ago. So, um you know, it's interesting to see that this this sort of AI enthusiasm light a fire even under some things that have been around for a while. Yeah. Yeah, Nebby and I had to read up on it was it's based in Amsterdam. Apparently, this is a company spun out from the Russian internet giant uh Yandex. Bloomberg donated has raised money from some a number of highprofile investors, including Nvidia, by the way. Yes, exactly. And then let's talk about Palunteer. That stock is seeing share prices dip in the red today after criticism about a possible plan struck between the company and President Trump or at least the administration more broadly and potential involvement in surveillance during former presidential administrations as well. The company won contracts from the Pentagon and Department of Homeland Security and could potentially win contracts from the Social Security Administration and Internal Revenue Service. according to reporting out there that could uh open the door to widespread consolidation of information. um a New York Times report. Another contributing factor um perhaps to the drop today, but really then sort of the uh the catalyst if you will was a report in Semaphore that said that Republicans are now concerned about Palunteer as well and that the Republicans maybe aren't convinced that this is a signature priority of President Trump. So maybe they're a little more willing to go up against him on this. Yeah, we'll see. They have representative Warren Davidson, Republican of Ohio, telling some of it's dangerous. He's talking about this. When you start combining all those data points on an individual into one database, it really essentially creates a digital ID. Um, where this goes from here if anywhere, we'll see. It doesn't look like Palanteer responded to some for with a comment there. Now, the stock I mean, listen, we're down today, but pull that chart back. I mean, yes, what another yet another incredible year for this name. I mean it's up more than 60% already this year. And we should mention they didn't respond to this particular semifur report that we know of but Alex Karp did give an interview today and lashed out against the New York Times report was highly critical of that. So he was critical in only way that Karp can be. Yeah. They have there was a lot of colorfully. Yes. Animated. Exactly. Animated. That's a great word for it. All right. Coming up it's the latest edition of our series Goodbye or Goodbye. We're taking a deeper dive into two stocks to help you make the best moves for your portfolio. Stick around. Much more market domination still to [Music] come. It's a big noisy universe of stocks out there. Welcome to Goodbye or Goodbye. Our goal to help cut through that noise to navigate the best moves for your portfolio. Today we're digging into valuation plays and I'm here with Ben Emmens, Fedatch advisor, founder and chief investment officer. Ben, it's good to see you. Thanks for being here. Good, good to be here, Julie. Yeah. So, let's talk about the stock that you think is a better buy right now, and that is Cityroup. Um, of course, the giant bank here. We've seen the stock stock do pretty well over the past year or so. So, let's get into why you think it's attractive. And first, we start, as I mentioned, uh, with the valuation here. So when we're talking about banks, we usually talk about price to book. Correct. Um and so on that basis, how does it look? So it looks really cheap to the peer group because it's about.7 to book. That's the lowest ratio that's from all the major banks. And it may be to do with the book value in it by itself of of City Group in this case. as you mentioned, it's not always easy to value, but I think it's a a bank that has come out of the financial crisis as a really a trouble bank has been in this L-shaped form of this chart if you look back from 2008 and because of the restructuring that's going on, it finally gets some life and finally becomes like more valuable and that's not reflected in this book value yet. So, it's just really cheap stock. Interesting. All right. And so, um, the ca the bank has been trying to really, you know, under CEO Jane Frasier has really been trying to improve things, to slim down, um, and then also to grow more, right? So, what's your sort of grade that you would give that revamp that they've been doing? So, I would give it an A minus so far because you think of Cityroup, it was a is actually a bank with consisting of a lot of different parts. member of Travelers Group or Salon Brothers or other type of pieces and in this in the financial crisis obviously got this major trouble. It was a very bloated bank and it took them years to really work off but it actually really took the leadership ultimately from Jane Fraser in this case that really took dramatic measures just like recently where they had again unfortunate for these layoffs but in the case of Cityroup for how investors reward the bank. Yeah, it's somewhat needed to get this this 20,000 people that they have scheduled to, you know, basically let go unfortunately. But yeah, for this bank the revival and I think this is what's working out so far. And then there's the other part I mentioned which is the earnings growth, right? That also has to deliver in order for the stock to go up and we there we've seen some promising signs as well. Yeah, that's interesting actually. So there they have earning surprises very consistently since 2022. But if you compare to the peer group, they're roughly about an earning surprise of 15% to the median earnings estimate. Whereas the other banks who are much more valued than City Group is, they're earning surprise something like 8 to 10% to the median estimate. So that difference is interesting. So you have an undervalued bank that continues to be outperforming on earnings and yet it's not reflected in the valuation. I think that's why it's an interesting stock. What do you think would change all of that? what would be the catalyst to get investors to sort of wake up to the opportunity that you see here? Yeah, I think it's it's a matter of like recognizing that that the consistency of earnings is there. I think they also wanted to see how this restructuring plan really plays out because you know City Group has a big China operation. That's obviously a challenge. What we'll talk about in a sec that's obviously a challenge and then I think it's about just the legacy. you know, city group does sit on legacy assets just takes time to work that off. I think that's all the reason why. And and you mentioned this challenge here and the risk that the China expansion that they've made that that could be maybe slowed down or hindered if there are more restrictions from the US. Yeah. And that's I obviously a sentiment factor here as we're in this tariff trade war discussion. You saw the city trading up a little bit on these headlines when when the deal from from from Trump chi came out released a phone call just tells you about a lot about that but then again it is not simple you know doing business with China is difficult and to actually have restrictions from the government that's that makes it difficult so I think that's is the the drawback to the to the story why maybe that's why it is somewhat underperforming its peer group. Gotcha. All right, let's get to the stock you think investors should avoid. That's Apploving, which has been really um screaming higher. I mean, we saw the draw down, but now is still up considerably over the past year. And that you says means that it's overvalued. It's really overvalued. I mean, it trades like 60 times. PE takes in the forward about 40 times forward earnings. Now, it has had good earnings and it has actually had free cash flow, too, you know, and that's that's positive. But I do think I mean this maybe the second point is that that's just froth building in a stock like this right you can not only tell from the parabolic move but that also that as this point of sense like earnings been good but it's been slowing down clearly you know we've had like record earnings like two three years in a row and it's really come off that that peak so the stock has obviously went well ahead of this this record earnings so there's a bit of an overshoot there I think this is what the story is about ultimately you get a bit of the meme flavor here in this this type of stuff right sure and the froth that you talked about that's also drawn some short sellers uh to the stock right who have tried to come in here and criticize it and it's come down but as we saw from the chart it's still up a lot yeah it's actually almost up 900% since the start of this year I think if you own this stock or you purchased it on that time you know 900% is a significant gain so you could you know reallocate to the extent that way you know the volatility of the stock by the way is also at least three times The S&P index I think is almost like one and a half times more than his ultimate peer group which is like Roblox is one of those companies. So again, frothy stock here. You know, the popular song here is is it's like this McDonald's song, right? That loving it, but I think that it's not exactly the case. Not exactly the case. And then what could change your mind, right? Or what could continue the momentum here if it got added to the S&P 500? Well, that's an interesting news item that I saw today. It's going to be announced on Friday. What you know, tomorrow, which which companies will be included, and they're on the list. This company has now about 135 billion in market cap. So it enters at an overvaluation and a larger market cap than some of the others that on that list. So if it is included then all the index funds have to buy this stock. Right. Right. And that's that's the opposite case. Then it could actually go to the record high from what we saw earlier. But we'll see because usually S&P tries to consider some of the things you're talking about when it decides whether to include a stock in the index. So we'll see what they'll see what happens. And do you have a position in either apploven or city? I have no position at no claim position. All right, Ben, thank you so much. And by the way, you're going to stick around and be back with us in a moment. But thank you so much for watching Goodbye or Goodbye, where we bring you new episodes at 3:30 p.m. Eastern. [Music]"
