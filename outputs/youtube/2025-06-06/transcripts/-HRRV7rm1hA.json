  "transcript": "What's up Tesla family? It's Ray J back with another video. And in this one, I want to break down what's happening with SPY, Tesla, and the overall markets. I'm going to talk about some key levels to watch from what's happening with the charts thus far. Just know that I am not a financial planner, so take nothing I'm saying as financial advice. Anyways, as far as Tesla's going, as you guys could tell, we have a left shoulder, a head, and a right shoulder that's forming at least so far. Now, Tesla's starting to break structure right here at this 330 area. And for now, we still look kind of weak as we're continuing to fall during the pre-market session. Now, we have this support right here at this 320 area. We have to see if Tesla could hold this. If we don't hold this, we could be visiting our gap support, which happens to be around that 314 area. So, about right over here. That's going to be the next main support in case we do end up failing at uh 320. And to be bullish, you want to see us get back above essentially 330. So overall we have a head and shoulders. There's a little bit of weakness in Tesla, but the question is what's going to be affecting it. I want to talk about that first and I'll break down more details about this chart. There's been lots of talk about Elon Musk about how whether or not he can get Tesla back on track because right now things are not looking too good for them in Europe and we have heard Elon Musk acknowledge that that the sales in Europe are going to remain weak for some time. But he is saying that it's nothing to worry about because he believes Tesla will make a strong comeback when the time is right. He also said that this is just a very very temporary phase. Um despite that, right, we had a Dan Ives say that it's very important for Elon Musk to end this chapter and start working on Tesla's next stage of growth because Tesla now needs that to really really rebuild its reputation to see a lot of growth. There's also been some talk about Elon Musk is not really happy about the spending bill, but one of the things he might not be happy about is the effect it may have on tax credits for EVs. Could that negatively affect us? We'll have to see about that depending on if the bill passes and what else happens to it. But if that does end up affecting these tax credits, that could also hurt Tesla to some extent. Now, I understand that Elon Musk is saying that, you know, if we get rid of tax credits, it's going to hurt Tesla's competition more. And he wasn't really worried about that. But at the same time, given the fact that we are seeing some demand issues, these credits could be a little bit more negative for Tesla if they end up getting eliminated. So, we'll see about that, right? It's something that's worth mentioning. I'm seeing a lot of headlines talking about this. On top of this, the UK sales are down 45% for the month of May. So, not the best of news for Tesla. That's a big drop. They only sold about 1758 units last month in the month of May in the United Kingdom. That is down 45% or more from what we saw last year. Now, this is once again not a surprise as we're seeing lots of sales declines throughout Germany, the UK, Spain, Denmark, and many other regions. Some regions like Norway are doing well, but the majority are still kind of weak in Europe. The Chinese-made EV sales are also down quite a bit. Um, they're also down about 15% in the month of May. Um, they only ended up exporting about 61,662 of the vehicles. That is also a bit of a decrease. So, not the best of news for Tesla. So, lots of bad news is coming out right now. You know, we're seeing lots of headlines about how their deliveries are just very very weak and how it's going to be affecting us. I think that's part of why Tesla's still kind of weak here. We're going to see if we could hold this 320 area if we can. We're looking for, you know, these next supports. So, please be very careful. Um, when it comes to news, our exports were technically above expectations and imports were pretty much aligned with expectations. initial jobless claims was a little bit above expectations and besides that all we have today are a couple of bill auctions and a couple of a couple of Fed speakers like Huggler giving their speeches. So that's it for today. There's not really much else significant data. Um we're going to be listening to see what else happens. Um I think that there's been some news that came out that President Trump did speak with Xi Jinping according to some Chinese media. I think this is a little bit optimistic for the markets. So, the market is actually more optimistic about this, but um keep in mind that now there's a lot of headlines saying that Elon Musk is not happy with President Trump and the spending bills. So, they're trying to paint the narrative that Musk and Trump are not friends, this and that. Like, I completely understand that. Um but you have to understand that Musk has praised President Trump and Trump has praised him. They're still good friends. They've been talking a lot with one another and they still get along very well. It's not really right to say that they're enemies. It's more like what's happening is he just doesn't agree with the spending bill. Besides that, he does still get along very well with President Trump. Um, besides that, there's not not anything else that's too crazy on the news. So, that being said, what's happening? The news about President Trump speaking to Xi Jinping. I think the news just came out. That is more optimistic for the market. That's why the market's trying to like hold up right now. But Tesla in particular is weak. We're very weak right now. Um, so what we're going to be doing is looking to see how this ends up panning out. Is this a left shoulder head and right shoulder setup and we need to see Tesla reclaim like 337 to really rebound. If we can't do that, we're looking for 320 if that does not hold. I could be looking for essentially this like 314 to 315 area next and eventually 310, which is where the 200 EMA happens to be. I do see a risk of us dipping a little bit more looking at this setup. And if we lose this red 200 EMA, we could be coming down to fill this gap all the way down to the low 300s. So, we still look weak, guys. Let's see if we could hold 320 or not. If we don't hold this, we could be looking for a bigger dip to 315 to 310. I want to see us reclaim at least 325 and eventually 330 to see some kind of a rebound move. But for now, Tesla is still kind of weak and we're favoring a test of 320 or below if that ends up failing. So, please be very careful. SPY pushed to about 598. If we could break and hold above that, we're looking for an attempt for the 600s. But if we end up failing and we can't hold 595, we're looking for a dip back down to like 592 to 590. We're rangebound right now. So, we're going to see which way we end up going. We're just going back and forth for now. Although, the news about President Trump making the call with Chipping Ping is a bit more optimistic. We'll see if President Trump helps us launch higher. If we break 598 today, we're bullish. If we lose 595, we're looking for a dip. Otherwise, we're completely rangebound until we see one of these levels break. So, be very, very patient nonetheless. For the QQQ, we have resistance at 530. If that breaks, we're looking for an attempt to push for 532.5. We're also going to be bearish if we end up failing at 527.5. If that fails us, we could be dipping down to 525 or below. So, it could go either way. We're just rangebound on the QQQ between 530 and 528. So, I do expect us to trade sideways here. We'll have to see which way we end up breaking. If we lose 527.5, looking for a bigger dip. And if we break 530, we're bullish. As of right now, we're just completely rangebound like this. So, if you look at the premarket, we're just kind of stuck. So, we're going to see if this breaks out higher with the news about President Trump calling Chi Ping officially or if we're about to get a rejection. Watch your levels just to be safe for the IWM. We're also stuck right here. If we break 210, we're looking for an attempt to get back up towards 212.5 or above. If we lose 206, we're looking for a dump back down. Hopefully, this bounces and breaks 211. So, we'll see about that. For ES, we also have a cup and handle. If we break 6,000, we're looking for a bigger pump towards 6,000. Uh, you know, higher levels like 6,50 or so. And for bearish, you want to see us lose 5964 and 5950 with those fills. We dump back down. We're technically rangebound, but we'll see if we break out or not. I do expect us to trade sideways between 5964 and 6,000 until we see one of these levels break or range bound. So give that some time. NQ is making higher lows. If we continue to break out to break past 21,850 and hold above that. If we do, we're looking for 22,000 plus. If we lose 21,600, we're looking for a dip to 21,500 or below. So watch this range between 21,650 and 22,000. Whichever way we break will cause a much larger move. For Bitcoin, we're making higher lows. If we break 106,000, we're looking for a bigger push to 107,500. But if we end up losing this trend line, we're going to be dipping. This looks a little bit more bullish as we're trying to ride this higher. So, there's potential for us to rebound. For Nvidia, if we end up losing 140, we're looking for a dip back down to 135. If we break 144, we're looking more bullish, looking for an attempt to break out from 148. It's rangebound in the low 140s. So, we'll see if this could break 144. Apple is now getting bought back up. If we lose 202, we're looking for a dip back down. But with this news about President Trump calling Chiing Ping, we could be looking for 205 plus. So, there's potential to bounce. AMD is on an uptrend. As long as we don't lose 118, we're favoring the 120s. Coinbase has the inverse head and shoulders we were talking about. So, right, we have this left shoulder head and right shoulder for an inverse head and shoulders. Break 26. We're looking for an attempt for 268 all over again. Amazon's balancing with the news about Xi Jinping and also more talk about some bullish uh news that came out. Um we have some more buyers stepping in. So we're looking for 212 as our potential target. Meta as long as we're above 690, we're favoring 700. Google is looking more bullish, looking for 174. And then uh sorry, Microsoft is also holding up well. If we lose 461, we're looking for a dip back down. But as of right now, we could be looking for 466. So the market's looking decent. We could start to push more now if we could hold above 598. We could remain bullish. I did warn you guys about some sideways price action. Maybe a dip that could have been coming if we got bad news. But now the market's looking more optimistic with the fact that President Trump has called a Chi Jinping officially. So, you know, that could cause us to push more. So, we'll see if we break resistance. However, for Tesla, make sure you watch supply and demand the levels we called out. Just know that we still look weak. So, we'll see if we could hold 320 or not. If we fail there though, expect us to dip closer to 315 or below. Tesla is still weak here, so I just want to give you guys a warning about this, especially since we saw there still's decline. So, please be very, very patient with Tesla and we'll see what ends up happening. Thank you for listening. Have a good one and peace"
