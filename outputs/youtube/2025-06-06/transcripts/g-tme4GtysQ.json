So, I want to thank each and every one of you for being here today. And without further ado, let's get right into it. And it's my honor and pleasure to welcome back our keynote speaker, the great Stephanie Link, chief investment strategist and portfolio manager for High Tower Advisors. Take it away, Stephanie. I'm Stephanie Link, and I'm delighted to be here today to talk a little bit about the ETF world and maybe a few ideas along the way. Uh I just thought we would start with a breakdown of the ETF market just a couple of steps which I find fascinating. Uh the global ETF market is a 13.7 trillion market aum. Uh year-to-ate inflows into the ETF world has been 1.04 trillion. That's new flows this year alone. The compounded annual growth rate of ETFs is about 13 to 18%. That is three times the growth of mutual funds. On the active ETF front, this is where it get kind of gets exciting. They all the active ETFs only have about a 7% market share. And that market is $995 billion today. Black Rockck actually estimates that by 2030 this active ETF this part of the market will be $4 trillion in AUM or 16% market share. So that's the area where there is real growth. Uh the US is 77% of total ETF AUM. And so why would you use an ETF? I think first and foremost because it's diversified. Um they always say don't put all your eggs in one basket in one name in the market. That's very risky. Some can do that if you like but the recommendation is to have a diversified portfolio. Uh and ETFs offer that. They could be broad-based like the S&P 500 where you have 500 companies actually 501 companies um that are represented uh into the ETF or you can own more concentrated for uh ETFs uh which have 10 20 30 uh stocks in in an ETF. Um, it could have you could be sectorbased ETF if you really like a sector and that's what I'm going to talk about in a little bit because I I do have a few ideas for you. Um, in terms of size, it could be you could own a large cap ETF or or an ETF that has just small cap companies or midcap companies. You could own an ETF that's value or growth or core, which is a combination of value and growth. So, there's a lot of options. Um, and I didn't even touch on international. You certainly can own the international uh markets as well. You can own a single country. So, there's a lot of various different ideas out there in the ETF world. And what the way I like to to think about it is uh to have uh a portfolio of of stocks and they could be as I happen to have a concentrated portfolio but they could be you know as many as you like but also to supplement it with an ETF if you like a theme and I'm going to talk about that uh in one of my ideas as well. The most important part of though ETFs, it's liquid, they're low cost, uh, and there are tax efficiencies. Uh, as they're changes that are made into the portfolio, uh, the owner of that ETF does not have to deal with the, um, the tax implications on a real-time basis. Uh, and in active ETFs, that's certainly one of the advantages for certain. uh as an active portfolio manager um you take gains and you take losses and and and uh obviously the there's a lot of implications for um the people that own those. So you don't have to do that. You don't have to worry about that. You don't have to worry about the trading aspect of it. So what are some ideas? Um so I uh am an um kind of big picture investor. That's how I start my investment process. And then I I am really big on themes uh because no matter what happens in the marketplace, if I truly believe in these themes that I'm about to talk about, um tariff issues, the economy, uh going, you know, up or down, uh political geopolitical issues, none of that is going to really impact the themes, at least that I like for the long term. And then I look at individual stocks and I do the fundamental analysis based on these themes. But you could do it via ETFs as well. Um and so the first theme I'd like to talk about is probably the the biggest and the most important theme that I believe for the next decade and that is cyber security. uh we are um really just at the beginning stages in cyber security and if you believe in AI which I think we all do cyber security is going to be bigger than AI because of AI uh and all the complexities we have 4,000 cyber sec security companies in the world some are public and some are private uh and none of them really talk to each other so I think what you're going to see is over the next decade decade the big five companies uh get bigger and bigger and bigger and do more and more M&A and there are a lot to choose from and again it's because none of this none of the companies really do talk to each other and so a vendor has to use many different cyber security companies something to the tune of like 20 to 25 vendors well if you talk to any chief technology officers they will tell you that they don't want to use 20 to 25 vendors it's too complex it's too expensive And so they don't want to use just one vendor, but they want to use less vendors, but the vendors don't offer everything that they need. So I think the big five are going to eventually offer everything that um companies and their clients need. And so I would look at CIBR, that is the ETF. They believe it or not the number one company in CIBR is Broadcom which uh they certainly do have some security uh cyber security components and they obviously make the chips uh into the systems but uh I I was surprised to see that that one is the number one uh bet but I like Broadcom for a lot of different reasons but other companies like Crowdstrike, Cisco, Palo Alto, Zscaler, Cyber Arc these are cloud cloudflare um the there are many others that they actually that that are in this ETF, but the big ones are the ones that you want exposure to and that is what this particular uh ETF offers. And the same thing with Hack HK, similar companies, similar um uh percentages in terms of the same companies in that ETF. So you can choose which one you want. Just know that the individual stocks can be very very volatile. So that makes this ETF that much more interesting to me. So you can kind of sleep at night a bit in terms of not as much volatility as the underlying uh equities. The second um theme probably almost tied with cyber security in terms of my conviction over the next decade has everything to do with the power and grid. As I mentioned, you know, we all believe in AI. We know that we're in early innings in AI for sure, but if you believe in that to be the case, then you need data centers. and we only have four uh 5,400 data centers in the the United States and 11,000 around the world. You are going to see explosive growth in data centers and I don't think anything that Deep Seek could do which we learned about in January is going to impact anything with regards to the data center buildout. So then if you believe in that then you have to believe in the grid and the grid has not seen incremental money spent on on it in over 50 years and in fact eaten corp they give out stats all the time and in their most recent uh conference call they said 70% of the grid is 25 years or old 25 years old or older. So we haven't spent money on the grid. We need to spend money on the grid. We we are starting to see it uh certainly but uh we have a long way to go. And then if you course if you believe in the grid upgrade and the grid uh increases in terms of spend then you know you need power and we're seeing power deals left and right in natural gas in nuclear uh across the in wind renewables. I mean that's why some of the infrastructure companies have really done quite well over the last year um because uh of the need and the growing backlogs as well as increasing margins as a result of this demand. So if you want if you believe in the this power in grid well then you want to own grid grid uh Johnson Controls Eaton Quant Services Active Hubble a lot of other companies as well but you get a lot a nice uh variety of companies that I think uh you'd like to have exposure to. I certainly do. Um in fact I have in my portfolio I actually own four different companies stocks um on this particular theme. Uh, another theme, um, and this is I'm going to put my Peter Lynch hat on, uh, which is invest in what you know. Uh, I own, uh, three pets, and I think I spend more on my pets than my 18-year-old. Don't tell her that, though. Uh, and so you want to have exposure to animal health. We are going to spend $150 billion on animal health and wellness this year. And we are going to get to three probably 350 billion by 2027. And so you want to have exposure to this theme. Seven out of ten people in this country own pets. That's more than that they they uh than children. So it's a big theme for me. And really at the end of the day on the uh on the wellness side and the health set on the science side there's really only three companies that uh are uh investable if you will and that would be Zoetis which is the number one company. Uh that would be Idex Labs and that would be Elonco. Uh well, all three of them are into this ETF and of course Chewy, as you would imagine, is into this uh into this uh ETF and and Merc because they have an animal health division. Um the symbol is P A WZ pause. So that's another theme. Moving on to another theme altogether uh would be aerospace. I'm a big believer in aerospace uh especially because the industry is a duopoly in terms of the plane makers. We have Boeing and we have Airbus. Uh, of course we know the problems with Boeing. Uh, I think they're fixable. In fact, I own the stock and I have been on record saying that Boeing is my favorite stock of the year. And that is because you have a new CEO changing the culture, changing the execution, building back the relationship with the FAA, management changes, cultural changes, and now we're at an inflection point where they're starting to see an increase in production. And then deliveries. They'll probably deliver 500 planes this year. that will help their free cash flow. And of course, as I said, as I mentioned, it's a duopoly with Airbus. The two companies have about 13,000 planes in their backlog. Um, and uh that's quite quite a bit of visibility. Seven years worth of backlog at Boeing. So, as you'd imagine, this ETF is ITA and Boeing is in it, of course. Uh, GE, RAON, um, North Bremen and L3 Harris just to name a few. Uh, moving along on the, uh, housing front, this is pretty controversial. Nobody really likes housing. I think I'm the only one. I think this is a long-term theme, though. You need interest rates to come down. It's plain and simple as that. But I do think you will eventually see interest rates come down, and I think the demand, there's such pent-up demand out there, especially for the first time home buyer. Uh, so we have 5 million homes that were short in this country. We have 5 million millennials that want to buy a first-time home. And if you talk to any home builder, they'll tell you they have underproduced uh for the last 15 consecutive years. They would rather buy back their stock than actually uh buy um and build uh on their land. Um and so you have a couple of names in the uh XHB. Uh you have Carile, you have Lowe's, you have JCI, you have Home Depot, you have Lowe's. Um I mentioned Lowe's. um Taylor Morrison. Um and so you have a nice representation there. This is not a theme that is likely to work with 30-year fixed mortgages at at 7%, but I do think over time you are going to see rates come down, demand is there, and you have again we're we have a shortage. It's not a uh it's really not um a supply problem. Excuse not a demand problem. Uh and it's not a supply problem. It is a problem of just overall people just waiting on the sidelines. So I think that eventually will uh res will resolve itself. You can own the if you like financials the XLF you can own uh the u SMH on the semiconductor side. I like some of these other thematic ETFs. And one last one I'll leave you with is uh internationally as I mentioned you can own all of the international countries and have a lot different exposure or you can own a country by country my favorite country is India and the reason is because the demographics are enormous 1.4 4 billion people in the country, 40% of which are under the age of 25 years old. You have a prime minister that has been in office since 2014 and he has uh been very focused, laser focused on building out the infrastructure. Since 2014, um, Prime Minister Modi has increased the highway lengths by 60%. That's just tell you how much he's doing and yet there's still so much to go. He is going to spend $1.7 trillion dollars between now and and 2030 on infrastructure alone. And of course they do have very businessfriendly policies. They have um a they're in the process actually right now of lowering interest rates. So the monetary policies are in place. Um and they are focused on the middle class as I mentioned infrastructure but anything that's tied to infrastructure. I mean just think of telecom, just think of um the manufacturing. Uh think about companies that are leaving China to go to India because they want to diversify their supply chains. Uh Tim Cook has been on record saying that he wants to build one out of every four phones in India over the coming years. He does currently build one out of every seven phones um in in India. So he wants to certainly improve and increase and he and and Apple is not alone. G GE has moved there, Pepsi, Coke, Google, IBM, lot of different companies uh that are moving into into India. So this ETF is INDA. So those are my themes. I hope that this helped. Um, I'm always willing to to be challenged and to chat about a lot of different ideas, but it's been a pleasure to uh to to be speaking to you today and um hopefully we all make some money along the way. Thanks so much, Stephanie. Great stuff. What an awesome way to kick things off. And we know we are truly living in the digital asset age, so how can we not talk about crypto? Really excited to toss it to my man Chris Catchy who is going to host the cryptos ETFs panel with Christopher Gennady the global head of research for Wisdomree, Andrew Nelson, director of product strategy for innovator and Ryan Rasmusen the head of research for Bitwise asset management. It's all yours Chris. Hey everyone and thanks for that intro. Chris Catchy from Benzinga here. Today's ETF Revolution event talks about innovation redefining investor portfolios. And on the topic of innovation, one of the biggest innovation stories in ETF history is the approval of Bitcoin ETFs and the growth of cryptoreated ETFs. I'm pleased to be joined by three leaders of three exciting companies helping to pave the way in the cryptocurrency ETF space. Please join me in welcoming in Chris Gennady, global head of research at Wisdomree, Andrew Nelson, director of product strategy at Innovator, and Ryan Rasmusen, head of research, Bitwise asset management. Welcome, gentlemen. All right, let's kick off the questions here, guys. So up first, you know, if we take a step back, Bitcoin ETF approval, many in the crypto space were optimistic, but it really seems like demand and performance has beaten even the most bullish cases for inflows and assets under management. How does early demand and inflows compare to your expectations? Chris, let's start with you on this one. Uh at at Wizantry, we've uh been amazed to watch the appetite, the adoption. Uh it's clear that there there was some pent up almost like a coiled spring type of activity in anticipation. Now it's it's a bit crazy to consider that maybe we're call it uh 16 17 months removed from zero day which was January 11th uh 2024. That was uh the day when 11 different funds were all approved. Uh and you saw incredible growth. I think everyone was predicting people were going to look for the lowest fee options. There were certain providers that even waved fees uh to zero uh which which is amazing to see that type of competition within the ETF landscape. Uh but in in addition to people moving from say a more expensive vehicle to a less expensive vehicle, you also saw and and where we get the most excited at Wisdom Tree is when you see different pension funds at the state level around the United States who who may not have been able it's not the easiest thing to be able to set up a self-custody type uh arrangement if you work at these certain places. So in in a sense the ETF has allowed the overall asset allocation uh to add something new that that hasn't previously existed and really didn't exist at all if you go back say 15 or 16 years. So an amazing journey and in in some senses it's still only the beginning uh because I know there's a lot of other assets uh beyond just the Bitcoin story that one day may be approved. Yeah, I I would just second what Chris said there. The adoption and performance of the spot Bitcoin ETFs since they launched in the US last January has been absolutely incredible. For context, these are the most successful ETF launches of all time. Before the spot Bitcoin ETFs, the record for the year 1 inflows of any ETF was 5 billion in its first year. And we see that the Bitcoin ETFs did 35 billion in their first year. So a a magnitude better in terms of flows in year one. And we've seen flows continue so far into its second year of existence. And so we've been extremely excited at Bitwise about the adoption that we've seen of the spot Bitcoin ETFs. Advisors, as Chris mentioned, financial advisors, wealth managers, institutional investors can now access Bitcoin for the first time in a vehicle they're familiar with at a low cost that gives them access to institutional grade custody. It really is a gamecher for majority of the wealth in the US and and globally. And so we're extremely excited about it. We're excited for where things are headed. As Chris mentioned, we're just getting started, but already these have grown into, you know, more than 100 billion in AUM across the different ETFs that exist and investors choose different ETFs for different purposes. But far and wide, we've seen broad-based adoption. And I think we're just getting started. And perhaps, you know, by the end of this year, we'll have seen more flows than we saw in year one. You know, more than 35 billion. very exciting to see. And if I could just chime in also and provide a little different perspective, innovator ETFs where I'm at, we take a slightly different view. I mean, you have two experts here from from cryptonative backgrounds perhaps that are talking about the global spot market and that growth is what spurred our entry as well. So, we're known for having riskmanaged options-based ETFs and now we are watching closely that Bitcoin spot market because we saw that same demand developing, that same demand explode. And because of that, you had additional derivative interest off of just spot bitcoin. And so we'll discuss later today, but we're excited about it as well. Our ETF offers a slightly different take than just say broad spot-based exposure, but again, there's room for everybody. And seeing that market growth is what spurred our development as well. So I think that maybe a slight surprise on exact magnitude, but overall direction what we expected and because of that maturity we've seen in just the last year and a half. It's really led people like us at our firm to develop additional investment opportunities for clients to meet them where they're at, provide a different tool in their toolkit and give them opportunities that did not exist before. So, we're excited about it. Awesome. So, you know, I heard you guys mention custody pension funds, some of the different reasons, you know, why maybe investors are looking at Bitcoin ETFs. So, one of the big questions perhaps out there is why buy a Bitcoin or crypto ETF and not just invest in the cryptocurrencies directly. What do these ETFs provide? Let's start with Andrew on this one. I know your ETF is a little different with that downside protection bank. Yeah, thank you Chris. I think my fellow panelists will probably talk about things like simplicity, ease of implementation in work streams of current portfolio management possibly. But for us at innovator, taking a riskmanage approach is what is in our DNA. That's our bread and butter. And so in the Bitcoin space, our ETF is ticker symbol QBF as in quarterly Bitcoin floor. And if I was to summarize it in three quick sentences, it's Bitcoin 20% max loss and no cap. And what I mean by that is that you are getting Bitcoin exposure in the portfolio but we are utilizing options to do so. When we do that we are able to construct an outcome that is not achievable by holding say pure spot bitcoin. In this case our methodology we've developed is allowing you to reset your protection each quarter in the portfolio. And that protection is a 20% floor. So what that means for you is that you cannot lose more than 20% each quarter on your Bitcoin holdings. Now on the flip of that folks might ask what's my upside what's the catch here the catch is that you give up a bit of upside but there is no cap there's no hard cap and say people might expect so what we have in our ETF is a participation rate that participation rate will vary each quarter but the protection is static and so again protected on a 20% max loss each quarter participation rate right now is about 75% so say Bitcoin goes up 10% this ETF's up 7.5 you get the idea. We'll talk more later possibly about the details and nuances, but that's our take to say, hey, you cannot say engineer an outcome like that by just holding spot. We take the best of Bitcoin and add some guardrails around it and provide a unique exposure that you cannot get outside the ETF rapper. Ryan, how about you? Uh why should investors, you know, look towards Bitcoin ETFs over, you know, the actual cryptocurrency? Well, I think Andrew highlighted some some of the beauty that the ETF rapper offers, right? It doesn't just give you the pure option to have exposure to Bitcoin and nothing else. You can do a lot of creative things with the ETF rapper. Of course, at Bitwise, we launched the Bitwise Bitcoin spot ETF uh in January of last year. That's just pure Bitcoin exposure. I think an investor would choose that ETF for a number of the reasons that Andrew mentioned. It's a lowcost alternative to owning Bitcoin directly on an exchange or self-custody. Additionally, you get the access to institutionalgrade custody at a low cost that you wouldn't have if you were to self-custody the assets yourself or rely on a centralized exchange. You also get the peace of mind that this is in a regulated wrapper and it's regulated by the SEC. It's regularly audited at Bitwise. We use Coinbase as the custodian for the crypto assets and BNY for the cash custodian. And so there's a number of elements of the ETF rapper that make it more attractive in many cases to many investors as opposed to owning spot directly on your own through self- custody or on a centralized exchange. But I would clarify, you know, we're big fans of self-custody here at Bitwise. And our view is that investors should do all of it and different investors will take a different approach. And so I think it really just matters on what your goals are. If you're a financial adviser or a wealth manager, there's so much less risk of owning the ETF rather than trying to own the assets directly on behalf of your customers or are your clients owning Bitcoin themselves. It becomes part of your comprehensive wealth plan. It folds into the assets that you can build on, but it also folds into, you know, your purview of seeing what's happening. Can avoid your client selling or buying an asset on an emotional spike or dip. So, there's a number of reasons why wealth managers would choose ETFs. And then Andrew alluded to this, but you can do a lot of creative things with ETFs. You can create downside buffer ETFs. You can create momentum based ETFs. For instance, at Bitwise in December, we launched the TrendWise strategies, which offers Bitcoin exposure based on moving averages and onchain metrics. And so when those signals turn bullish, it allocates to Bitcoin. And when they turn bearish, it sells Bitcoin, allocates to treasuries. So there's just a lot of creativity there with ETFs that don't exist for investors who want to hold Bitcoin uh directly either on an exchange or through self-custody. But I think investors will take all three approach and it really depends on what your goals are as an investor or as a financial adviser, wealth manager. and Chris. So, I'll uh add add some uh some some uh some spice, some some different flavor here because we've we've heard uh the the benefits of the ETF structure. I I think the the financial industry is kind of funny in some ways and I know the title of this session uh includes the word innovation. Um, and in some respects, the financial industry is extremely innovative. But I was reading an article uh in the Wall Street Journal today as we're doing this recording about a major global bank and and this is like front page news in the Wall Street Journal tech section. They're using the large language models and AI to essentially upgrade their codebase, their software code base, uh which uh among other things still includes Cobalt, which could be a language that is 50 years plus uh in its uh development. And they're by far not the only one. So in in our industry, uh changing things, upgrading things, it's it's not always uh the easiest or the quickest uh sort of deal. And so the the ETF structure simply put takes this brand new thing that didn't exist until about say 15 or 16 years ago and puts it into a rapper that did exist and that everyone's comfortable with. And so those people who are, you know, not necessarily cryptonative where they're completely comfortable with their own seed phrases and their own wallets and uh hot storage, cold storage and all these different uh distinctions. um they're able to benefit and to essentially get the return stream associated with this brand new thing uh that can be additive and can be helpful and if they want to think about the US debt or the US dollar and potential risk they're in now there's a new tool on the table that they can easily use without feeling like they need to go through a whole tech uh class to be able to to not make any mistakes. Perfect. Uh great segue there, Chris. Uh you know, you mentioned headline news, right? Seeing those big headlines. Um it it seems like every week now we're hearing about, you know, a new country uh exploring, you know, adding Bitcoin to uh a strategic reserve or we're seeing a company add Bitcoin, you know, to to their holdings, whether it's, you know, GameStop or one of these smaller companies uh in recent weeks. So what does a headline news like that do for Bitcoin ETF uh demand and also for kind of validation? We we'll start with you Chris. Yeah. Yeah Chris. So at at Wisdom Tree we and and when we look at our research I mean uh the behavioral aspect in the financial world is uh among the more important ones. So when uh people look at say Micro Strategy and Michael Sailor and they see what's going on there um obviously there's been a certain degree of success a very very big numbers very very high net worths and so there there's a certain following uh that comes you know pe people with who have achieved great success they get a lot of attention and they get certain uh followers and hangers on and similarly in the country side of things talking about uh strategic reserves. It used to be you would have a strategic reserve if you were a country like Norway because you're selling a lot of oil or in the Middle East with natural gas, oil. So you have a lot of natural resources that you're selling and you're trying to deploy the profits from those natural resources in a certain way recognizing those things may not be there forever and you need to transition your economy. Well, now it's uh the fashionable just like a few years ago it was fashionable to say you were associated with uh Nvidia in the world of AI. It's fashionable to talk about uh strategic uh bitcoin reserves. Uh but what in our opinion is more interesting is how at least on the US side you've seen a shift in the regulatory tone. The regulatory tone I lived in Europe for five years from 2018 to 2023. uh and on the European side, usually in the ETF world, the US moves first and the European market moves and and follows. And that was not the case at all uh in the crypto world. I I would say and I would argue that the European regime and countries and exchanges which are different ones all over the European market, uh they are still a bit ahead. But the nice thing with the current administration is they are pushing the ball down the field in a positive direction. Uh it's not a done deal or a finished journey by any stretch. Uh but it is nice to see a change in tone relative to the prior administration and what uh these kind of crypto firms were having to deal with. Ryan, how about you? Yeah, look, I think it's crazy that we're seeing corporations and governments buy Bitcoin. Not in a bad way, but in the sense that a year ago or five years ago, this would have seemed absolutely crazy. And anyone saying this was going to happen would have been looked at as crazy and out of their mind. But this just shows how rapidly Bitcoin is being adopted at the institutional level. I think an interesting stat is that more than 5% of the Bitcoin supply today is held by corporations and governments. Corporations of course are a larger piece of that and within corporations you have micro strategy or strategy being the dominant player in the space but over the past few weeks we've seen a number of companies come out and say that they are adopting Bitcoin as a treasury asset. You mentioned GameStop bought over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin and there's a number of other companies across the globe. It's not just a US phenomenon that are buying Bitcoin as a Treasury asset. They cite things like hedging against fiscal irresponsibility, instabil instability, and geopolitical tensions on the rise in the, you know, federal debt deficit and spiraling inflation. All kinds of different reasons that they buy Bitcoin as a Treasury asset. And we also have seen governments come out and and say the same thing. I know at Bitwise we've been speaking with a number of sovereigns across the globe who are actively pursuing adding Bitcoin as a reserve asset either in their sovereign wealth fund or in a strategic reserve. And just last week at the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas, the world's largest Bitcoin conference, Pakistan announced that they were establishing a strategic Bitcoin reserve. And as I mentioned, we've been speaking to a number of sovereigns that are exploring doing so. And I think the game theory of it all starts to play into effect in that behavioral element that Chris mentioned is really a part here. No corporation or no government wants to be the last mover when it comes to this, right? And and I think that's what we're seeing play out live. And of course, we established a strategic Bitcoin reserve here in the US earlier in March, but we haven't yet started acquiring Bitcoin that we know of. But Bo Hines, who is helping work with Scott Bessant and Howard Lutnik and David Saxs on the president's crypto council, are actively speaking at conferences and across the different, you know, crypto media uh spectrum talking about how they're rapidly trying to identify ways to acquire additional Bitcoin on behalf of the US government. So, I think game theory plays and behavioral elements of it play a big role here, but I still think we're in the early stages of seeing mass adoption by governments and corporations. And that's really exciting for what it means from a validation perspective for Bitcoin as an asset and what it could mean for demand coming into an asset that's supply constrained and what that ultimately could mean for price. Chris, I would just take this maybe a slightly different direction because my colleagues here have done a great job describing already what it means from a behavioral finance and just a growth perspective and just the confidence boost it is in the general market to see large firms, pensions, nation states investing in Bitcoin. It comes back to though the idea to the last thing Ryan just said that the high demand will most likely drive price higher in a supply constrained environment. And that's why too I mean again thinking through the ETF construction process spot bitcoin ETFs do a great job giving you that that blanket exposure. And yet again through our lens typically for our ETF lineup we'll take say that buffer approach and cap your upside. Here I want to emphasize again there is no cap on the Bitcoin upside in the ETF. So you both get that guardrail, the guardrail side of the equation, but we are acknowledging certainly these developments in the marketplace just described to you here where demand is increasing and when you typically have demand increase, price follows. Now I'm not making a Bitcoin price call or guaranteeing anything. I think we know how volatile that marketplace is and yet you have seen a general trend up and to the right and so we want to give our clients access to the upside. We want to keep that good volatility and chop off the bad as the goal. I think all these conversation points just discussed now emphasize that further. Yeah, that's perfect. And you know, speaking of uh volatility and Ryan, you mentioned it. The the US Bitcoin strategic reserve, we haven't started buying yet. Um you know, I don't want price predictions or anything, but just like Andrew started to say, just talk a little bit about, you know, what happens when the US starts buying Bitcoin. Does that become a major catalyst for Bitcoin ETFs similar to when they first launched in January of last year or is this kind of, you know, already banked into demand? What are some of the predictions of when the US starts buying? What's going to happen to the market? Andrew, we'll we'll start with you here. Chris, that's a dangerous place for me to start trying to give a price prediction once the US starts buying the I I would take the politician stance and say it's middle of the road to what you just described. We think it's accretive to the bottom line as far as the price of Bitcoin. It will be reflective of that. It's a positive for the environment. But I do not think it's going to be the exact same say push into the marketplace that spot Bitcoin launches were. So I again I'm shrouding the fence. I acknowledge that. I think it's very hard to look into a crystal ball and describe what's going to happen to the price movement when you have many different factors. But we think it's a positive for the space. We see continued demand in the sense and growth in trajectory for the price. If you ask me come back in six months and give you a target, I just won't do it. But I'll defer to my esteemed colleagues to do so instead. But we do see it as a positive. And again, if you have the uncertainty around it, that's kind of why we've brought out these derivative based products just to help you do just that. Get exposure, but keep your keep your uh uh uh balancing act on. Ryan, how about you? Look, I think that there's a number of funnels of demand coming into Bitcoin today. We spoke about governments and corporations, but perhaps, you know, one anecdote to what would happen once the US government does start buying Bitcoin from from something I personally experienced. You know, at Bitwise, we're on the road every day speaking to investors, not just across the US, but in Europe. And I was at an event a few months ago with a bunch of CIOS from different pension funds, etc. And what they said to me was particularly interesting. They said, \"We're not yet investing in Bitcoin.\" And we asked them what would need to happen in order for you to to make that leap and start allocating Bitcoin even if it is just half a percent or 1% of the portfolio. And they specifically said we'd have to see the US government start buying Bitcoin for us to do so. So I think that is one of those monumental moments that provides this stamp of approval and derisks from a career risk perspective. So many wealth managers and CIOS and portfolio managers out there and they can say look the largest organization on planet earth is allocating to Bitcoin. So we're not crazy for for doing this. We're actually crazy for not doing this. And so I think that is a big zero to one moment. But I think there's a number of others out there like that. For instance, the the Trump admin just relaxed guidance to the Department of Labor on how 401k platforms and issuers and corporations that offer 401ks to their employees should approach crypto as part of those portfolios. There was a previous guidance that not many people talk about from the Biden administration that basically restricted employers from allowing their employees to access crypto in their 401ks. They were at risk of being uh receiving an enforcement action if they did do that. And why I bring up this extremely nuanced uh uh and point here is that 401k assets are 8 to n trillion globally. And the fact that they haven't been able to yet access Bitcoin just goes to show at how much demand is still gated and still pent up. So I think when governments like the US start accessing it, when they start relaxing guidance and you have this regulatory pivot in the US, the ripple effect into the demand for Bitcoin and therefore the price of Bitcoin is really hard to quantify. Our prediction going into this year is that Bitcoin would end the year at 200,000. And we predict in 2029 it'll surpass gold and be a million per Bitcoin. Of course, that's just a prediction and not advice. Uh the compliance uh person on my shoulder would have me say, but that's where we're where we're at and we still believe in those predictions. and Chris. Yeah. So, it's uh it's fascinating to to think and at Wisdom Tree when when we we can't help but see the irony here in the sense that you know you know we're we're basically discussing what was created as this decentralized asset. Uh it was created around the time of the financial crisis. It was meant to sort of provide this alternative and uh this sort of different path away from governments that had quote unquote messed up uh the system with what they were doing with interest rates and mortgages and all of that. And as we sit here, we're talking about, you know, the stamp of approval from among the biggest governments in the world actually buying this decentralized asset as being the key thing. Now, different people sort of have different visions and different hopes and dreams for the space. If the hope and dream is let's get to a million per Bitcoin as quickly as possible, there's probably few things better than a government like the US, possibly governments of the EU, all developed world governments, exchina, China sort of prohibits uh that. So, so they're they're kind of going a different way. But uh the more governments buy and follow on each other and if if the only goal is let's get that price as high as possible as fast as possible, it's obviously a great outcome. But if what is being attempted here is a new financial ecosystem where you're looking at the way certain things like say global remittances were done in the past and you see some inefficiencies, you want things done better. uh depending on the government as the answer or as the underwriter of you know viability for again this decentralized asset that's meant to be something different. Um it's it's a bit of a a weird uh justosition of of thought processes that you're putting together here. So I'll I'll be the different uh take uh again relative to my colleagues on the on the panel. Awesome. Well, we appreciate that. Well guys, uh last question here. Um, you know, obviously Bitcoin gets uh the spotlight, all the attention, but uh we are talking crypto ETFs in general. Um, so I know some of you have other crypto related products maybe already out or in the pipeline, but I'm wondering if I can get two thoughts from you. One being uh your own company, what other crypto ETFs, you know, do you have or are in the pipeline? And what do you think maybe gets approved next? Right. We've got Bitcoin, we've got Ethereum. Are we going to see, you know, Salana, XRP, Dogecoin ETFs in the future? So, Andrew, let's start with you, Innovator. Uh, what are you guys doing outside of that Bitcoin ETF and what are some predictions? So, outside of QBF, we actually do not offer any other cryptocurrency ETFs. And this is where I think the distinction for myself on this panel. Again, I want to be clear. We are not as a a deep crypto research firm, but we are absolutely a innovator in riskmanage optionsbased investing. Hence the reason that the crypto development has been so interesting to us to see this space grow. Now, we have done a bit of research certainly to underpin our offering uh our decision points around the product structure were very intentional. The idea to have that quarterly reset instead of say an annual reset, etc. So as we watch the development, what really matters to us is the options market and the options market developing around these spot bitcoin ETFs or these say spot ethereum ETFs. So we're not quite there yet amongst say the secondary asset classes or secondary assets amongst the crypto asset class but we are watching with a keen eye. Now the derivative-based uh bitcoin uh marketplace is quite a bit smaller. We'll acknowledge and say the spot bitcoin marketplace. It is growing but you have the the twin difficulties of education and awareness uh taking the four here for the the derivative based income. I'm sorry derivative based protection on bitcoin. Now if you're ask what's coming next for us though I would say we're looking at Ethereum of course because of just it its already approved nature and watching that develop. And then if you were to say handicap it beyond that, we're not going to be too outside the box here. I think Salana, XRP, etc. are growing uh strong as well. But again, we're really focused on that options market and how we can bring our expertise to the bear to bear on this sort of asset class and provide a value ad that others are not able to provide a thoughtful approach in that kind of riskmanage optionsbased ETF uh construct. Ryan, how about you? Uh what is Bitwise doing outside of Bitcoin ETFs and what are some uh predictions for future crypto uh ETFs? Yeah, Bitwise I am uh fortunate that I sit on the product development committee here and we're spending a lot of time thinking about what products do investors want access to and of course the regulatory pipeline of approval comes into play here. We have a team that's out in DC speaking with regulators and policy makers all the time. I can't speak to any particular asset or filing because we have a number of active filings. But what I can say more broadly about the things that we're looking at are, you know, different types of exposure. So momentum based exposure, as I referenced earlier, is very popular in other asset classes, but is relatively untouched here in the crypto industry. And so we launched trendwise strategies, which allow you to take risk on, risk off using momentum based signals, which you can't do if you just hold spot directly, for instance. But we're also looking at other thematic types of products. We recently launched the Bitwise Bitcoin standard corporations uh index which a fund tracks as well which allows you to get exposure to those corporations that own more than a thousand bitcoin on their balance sheet that we spoke about earlier. So I think crypto equities products or products wrapping publicly traded crypto companies are going to become increasingly popular and we recently launched covered call or options income strategies around a number of the leading publicly traded crypto companies like strategy, Coinbase and Marathon. So I think thematic momentum based products and index based products are probably what's coming next after we see you know a a uh a large amount of single asset ETPS launched for new assets that others mentioned on the call here. But really exciting. I think we're just at the tip of the iceberg and having two of the largest crypto assets and ETPs is great. Having momentum or buffer strategies around those is great. But what investors really want is broad-based exposure to the asset class. And I think we're starting to see that happen and we're most excited for what the indexing approach to crypto will ultimately do once index funds are approved and out there on the market. I think a lot of investors will take that approach as they do in other asset classes like equities and commodities etc. And Chris uh what does Wisdom Tree have outside of Bitcoin ETFs and what are some of those future predictions? So at at Wisdom Tree uh to to echo uh what my fellow panelists at Bitwise was uh was saying uh it's been it's been interesting to sort of think of the historical journey uh that we've been on and how in say the 2021ish period when interest rates were zero and money was being literally piped into bank accounts from uh the Fed, what was happening was if if you were just throwing any idea against the wall, it was uh just going up and to the right which which might have even coined that that meme of up and to the right that we all uh discuss and what was happening then is there were these non-ETF avenues that people were using to sort of create those index like strategies quote unquote the S&P 500 of crypto. So you have all these crypto assets and you say obviously Bitcoin was first. Obviously it's got certain benefits, certain intrinsic attributes, but uh it's not the only thing. Now we have to be honest and and recognize that then you had the Terral Luna issue and you had the FTX issue and it almost like paused the feeling around those things. people have sort of it feels like consolidated back around Bitcoin and it just so happens that now now fortunately it doesn't take that many years but it just so happens that now it's feeling like you have a healthier overall ecosystem and there might be a greater readiness looking towards those diver different types of diversified exposures and something we think about a lot is how do you balance it in the right way because market cap it's going to be mostly Bitcoin with a slice of uh of ether. Um looking at different ways to delineate and divide the exposure so that people are getting a unique risk profile that's uh different say than again just holding Bitcoin which obviously has led the way in our discussion and in the market uh in general. Awesome. Well, Ryan, Chris, and Andrew, uh, thank you guys so much for taking time out of your busy schedules and to join us here on the panel to talk about Bitcoin ETSs. This has been, uh, a great talk and a very interesting topic. Thanks for having us. Thank you. All right. Well, on behalf of Benzinga, that does it for our crypto ETF panel. I hope everyone enjoyed that talk and let's send things back over to Dan at the Benzingga HQ desk. Thanks so much, Chris. What a brilliant and informative discussion and obviously crypto absolutely here to stay. So, great stuff from Chris and his great guests. Next up is a conversation with Taylor Ratty, senior vice president business development for Rex Shares. I had a chance to catch up with Taylor earlier. Here is our fascinating discussion. As we continue the ETF revolution, how innovation is redefining investor portfolios virtual event, it is my true pleasure to welcome in Taylor Ry, senior vice president, business development for Rex Shares. Taylor, so great to be with you here on such a such a great day. Yeah. No, happy to be here. Excited to talk about what we're doing here at Rex and and dive into some of our products. Thanks for having me. Well, it's it's my pleasure and honor. Let's dive right into it. Let's talk about Rex. tell us a little bit about it and the products you offer. Yeah, so so Rex has been around for over a decade now and you we've really had our legacy and continue to bring that forward and in really providing more sophisticated products that were traditionally available only to the institutional marketplace to all all adviserss and all investors for that matter. It's not just financial professionals. It is your retail investors as well. So, you know, we're happy to be able to do that. And at Rex, we really have three main business lines or product verticals, if you will. So two of those are really focused on on the trader. So we have a series of micro sectors ETNs which are concentrated baskets focused on themes like big tech, big oil, big banks that provide three times long and short exposure. So you know those are products that you certainly want are to be more of a a trader oriented person for that uh type of exposure. We also have a partnership with Tuttle Capital Management for our T-Rex lineup of single stock inverse and levered products. Um, we then also have a a product suite that we continue to grow and build now, which is more investing focused and and long-term buy and hold. So, if you think things like covered call ETFs, and we're we're looking to expand that product suite out. We also recently launched back in in March, more nuance exposure, but it's really focused on Bitcoin corporate treasury convertible bond ETF. So that's looking to get exposure to converts to from issuers like Micro Strategy who are specifically doing that and issuing that debt to raise capital to purchase Bitcoin for their corporate treasury. So some really unique exposures across the board. It really is Taylor. It really is an ETF revolution. That's obviously the name of the event today. It's it's it's unbelievable. Let's let's talk about how you achieve some of these different exposures, options, swaps. How does that work? Yeah, absolutely. So you when you think about the the leverage and inverse exposure, so the ETNs and the micro sectors brand that we have, we're achieving those through total return swaps. Similarly with the the T-Rex brand of single stock leverage and inverse predominantly we're gaining that exposure through swap as well. However, some of those products have taken off and become incredibly popular. And so with that you we we do supplement the swap exposure with listed option exposure. And how we're achieving that is if you purchase deep in the money options, then you can have much closer of a delta to one, meaning that you're just getting like for-like exposure to the underlying security and you also are able to do so with a lower capital requirement just because of the options in general. Now, if you flip that, right, I mentioned listed options. We are also using listed options for our covered call products. We have three main flagship products right now in that space. one's focused on big tech, another focused on AI, and another focused on on more of the digital asset ecosystem or crypto equity in in in general. Um, and with those we're using listed options and not flex at the moment. We do have the ability to, but it becomes a little more cumbersome when you have portfolios of 15 to 25 stocks where we are actually writing the options on the individual securities themselves. Um however we did launch last week and three more single stock covered call ETFs today uh where we are using flex exposure or flex options and the primary reason that we want to do that is because we have more ability to really focus what we want that contract to look like and in particular with that we're able to have cash settled options you know and that's important in case the options are called away early um we're able to do that with with cash settled options so it doesn't disrupt the underlying portfolio and the exposure So different ways to access different types of exposures, but it's really great with what we have, you know, at our disposal to capture these types of of exposures nowadays. Yeah, it really is. It's fascinating. And Taylor, I want to dive in on the covered call ETFs. What is it that makes them different from other covered call ETFs in the market right now? Yeah. Uh, so we launched our first covered call ETF. It's Feppy FEI. It's a fang innovation big tech focused covered call strategy in October of 2023 and you know the covered call universe five years ago was only a couple of billion dollars. Today we have it at pegged at over 116 billion. So explosive growth across the segment. Uh but what we notice is that a lot and almost all of the major competitors and peers out in that space are writing calls at the index level. And what's really unique about that relative to what we're doing writing at the individual security level is when you think about options and premiums that you're collecting, the main driver of of what that what that actually looks like is the level of implied volatility. So as you can imagine, Nvidia Micro Strategy have substantially higher implied volatility than what you would see at the index level even of the NASDAQ 100, right? You're talking implied volatility of that index roughly 20%. And you can get Palunteer up to 50 60 70%. Right? So these are more volatile stocks. But what that does for us is allows us two things. We're able to capture more premium and I'm talking with FEP 2.1% a month or 25% annualized. AIPI is our AI focused product. That's 34.8 a year or 2.9 a month. And then SEPY is our crypto equity covered call product. That's 42% annualized distribution or 3.5% a month. Typically when I bring that up with investors a lot of the time I'm you know it's received with some skepticism like how are you able to do that? Are you just eroding NAV? And in reality we're not looking at our monthly distributions and monthly premiums since launch of each of these products. FEP has actually been able to supplement that with capturing premiums of over 50 basis points in addition to the distribution meaning 2.6% we're distributing 2.1 on average per month go up to SEI it's over a 100 basis points. So these are very wellsupported distributions despite being so high. So that's point number one. Point number two is that implied volatility really allows us to also write further out of the money. So a lot of these bigger players are writing close to or at the money which means your upside is being captured. Most of the time these are these are one month expiry options which ours are too but it's important to be able to capture additional upside participate in upside capital appreciation but also and more importantly these are exposed to the downside. So if you have an environment like we recently saw in kind of March, April or last year during July August during a tech selloff where feepy was down 14% the uncovered version of the index was down 19 and a half. So we had you know some buffer on the way down but it only took us two and a half months to recover that 14% draw down which is incredibly important when you're talking about these these higher distributions to be able to recover NAV. So we think it's a really interesting approach to capture substantially higher premiums and higher distribution for our clients while also maintaining capital appreciation prospects. That is pretty incredible the numbers you just gave there. You know obviously investors look watching today I think they're wondering how do you want to see them you know use these strategies? How should they look to do that? Yeah. So, look, I I'll start with general covered call use cases. And I think, you know, there are benefits to some of the the pure products out there, right? Like, of course there are. If you're writing calls on the S&P 500, and you're an adviser, you're an investor, and you're saying to yourself, you know what, I think the market's a little bit frothy. I think valuations are a little bit higher. I want to I still want access to equities, but I want a lower beta approach. The way that you can go about that is maybe carve out part of your large cap core exposure and maybe it's 20% or whatever whatever you feel comfortable makes sense for you from a portfolio construction perspective and you're able to increase your premiums or increase your yield and lower your beta to that part of the portfolio. So it can be used as a beta reduction. Similarly with our products, if you have clients who are heavily invested in tech focused or tech forward areas of the market, you can have a lower beta approach and pull forward some of those distributions or some of the returns through the premiums that you collect. We've also seen people with our products in particular, I'd say the number one use case is really more of an income model portfolio and it's a capital efficient way to meaningfully increase an overall portfolio yield. Right? If you take 10% of an income model, you're adding at the aggregate level 2.5% with fee, right? And that's the lowest yielding portfolio that we or product that we have. Um, also clients have used this in a way if you have a more equity income focused pro portfolio where you're typically getting more dividend yield and that's coming from more valueoriented sectors. Typically, you don't get a lot of dividend from growth. Within FEP, it's roughly 50 basis points of dividends per year. So you're able to have a lot more sector diversification in that sense. Um I feel like a lot the other piece is we've had a lot of clients and a lot of discussion in the industry at large about the 6040 is it broken? Um and a lot of people are starting to think and rethink how do we hedge that exposure which was traditional long-term fixed income or long duration. You can now achieve this through derivative focused products whether it's buffered ETFs or using something like covered call ETFs. So, a lot of different use cases and can be very nuanced depending on on the advisor's goal and the end clients. Oh, it sure can. And nuance can be a good thing too and obviously with people like you, you know, it makes it easier. Uh, you know, if you would, could you walk us through tax treatment? Are there, you know, these better as far as, you know, in qualified accounts or can they be used in taxable accounts as well? I know it's going to be an important question with people watching today. Absolutely. This is probably, you know, tax usually ends up being a more boring topic for people, but this is actually a really good start. Yeah. But like, you know, the tax treatment within covered call ETFs is is actually a feature um especially with the way that we've constructed our portfolio. So, of course, these are these are great in qualified accounts, but don't don't think that they're not applicable within taxable accounts also. So, the way that this works is is you have something called return of capital as a tax classification. So you have capital gains tax classification and you also have ordinary income or net investment income. Return of capital sounds like it might be a bad term in that you know you give me a hundred bucks I start giving you 200 $2.1 back per month and it's your money. That's not in reality how it how it is actually working or functioning. What's actually happening is you're benefiting from tax deferred growth of the distributions. So return of capital what happens is your cost basis is reduced by the dollar amount that you've been distributed of those distributions that are are classified as return of capital. Um and the actual distributions themselves are not taxable in that current year. So if you are writing options or call options on your own within your portfolio and they're dated less than one year, you're paying short-term cap gains on those distributions. So incredibly tax disadvantaged in an ETF structure. Like I mentioned, those distributions end up being tax deferred. So you can either reinvest them and incrementally increase your cost basis or you can really think about taking that income if it's an older client or somebody who's trying to supplement lifestyle income. Um, and the only time that you're actually paying taxes on those return of capital distributions is when you sell the ETF shares. And so if you've held the ETF then for over a year, you're now paying long-term capital gains. So you have the tax deferral of the distributions and then you're actually paying a short or a lower tax rate in the future when you sell the ETF shares. Now there's one more small nuance to this that is really unique but again can be incredibly powerful for clients and adviserss is if you are thinking about estate planning and passing these these uh securities on to beneficiaries in the future you also have the option or not the option but the step up right and so if those are those are then been tax deferred you all of a sudden then have the the ETF securities then passed on to the beneficiary they get stepped up to current market rates and effectively you've who've had a majority of the portfolio being taxfree in that sense. Um, so again, nuance scenario, but one that's that's really interesting for people to chew on because you all of a sudden look at this and say, \"Wait a minute, this is incredible. You can really benefit from taxes in this.\" Taylor, you explained that beautifully and I think you just made taxes fun. I think that, you know, very few could do that. So, you you did it, man. It's it's not an easy thing to do. Uh, I want to talk about the option roll process if we can, Taylor. Is this purely systematic or does the approach have an active component? Yeah, it's a it's a little bit of both. I think systematic in the sense that you know we are writing uh you know within all of these portfolios we have monthly rebalancing of the portfolio to match the index. We also have quarterly reconstitution but on a monthly basis what we are doing is we are actually closing out the option positions on the Tuesday before expiry each month. Then we are rebalancing the portfolio to match the index weight. We're pulling out the for feppy 2.1% putting into cash or tea bills for the the upcoming distribution and then we're restriking options. So from a a systematic perspective in the sense that we follow that process on the Tuesday before before expiration each month. It can be active in the sense that we have portfolio managers that are actively identifying the strikes, right? They're certainly using uh models to identify the correct strikes, but they also have, you know, qualitative inputs that they they they overlay into the process. Um, but in addition to that, if any of the co the call option contracts fall in value by over 85%, that's sort of a soft target for us to take a look at the market and take a look at those contracts again and say, does it make sense for us to close these out early and then restrike options to capture more premium within the broader portfolio. So, that's kind of a loose threshold for us to to kind of step in, take an active approach and further uh bolster the nav of the portfolio. uh because within these portfolios we are softargeting those 2.1 2.9 3.5% monthly distributions that I I had mentioned previously. Taylor such a fascinating discussion I can't thank you enough for being here today. Before I let you go though I want to ask you what is next for Rex shares? Yeah so you know it feels like we're always doing something. We're always trying to push the envelope continue to innovate. I think we have some really interesting products. you know, we were the first to actually effectively get two times leverage within the ETF structure for our single stock um leverage and inverse products under the T-Rex brand. You know, for us, I mentioned right now our biggest focus has been on these single stock covered call ETFs. We now have four out there. We have Coin, Micro Strategy, Nvidia, and Tesla. Um three of those were launched today, so or yesterday. So, uh perfect timing for the market there. And then in addition to that, we continue to kind of look and see does it make sense to expand globally into new markets? Um what's the appetite for both option and derivative based products. So you know very excited to see where we move forward here. But um appreciate the time and and really had a a good time chatting with you today. Pleasure was all mine. Taylor Randy, senior vice president for business development for Rex Shares. Thank you so much for the wonderful discussion. Thank you. Absolutely great stuff from my man Taylor. There really is an ETF revolution these days, hence the name of our event. Now, I'm really looking forward to our next panel, how fixed income ETFs can be utilized in a volatile market. It is my pleasure to welcome in Steve Ley, global co-ad of fixed income ETFs, Black for Black Rockck, and Michael Venudo, the co-founder and CIO of Tidal. It is great to be with both of you for such a special event today, guys. Good to be with you, Michael. Yeah, nice to see you, Steve and Dan. Happy to be here. The dream is alive. Well, Michael, let me start with you. Let's talk about what some interesting alternative income ETFs are for this environment right now. Yes, I caught the tail end of Taylor's. I do think that there's a lot of people looking for more than the traditional yields that you get from fixed income and they're looking to get away from the duration risk that you get from fixed income. So, you know, um, at Title, we help people launch, grow, operate ETFs. So, we don't have any of our own ETFs, but we have the YieldMax brands or the Vista Shares brands or the Defiance brands. And we've seen an enormous amount of interest in the options income as a way to augment and um, create alternative forms of income out there. Steve, let me go to you. And well, the income is definitely backed in fixed income as we all know. Can you give the audience some perspective on how historic the current environment is? Yeah, I mean it's it's really um a generational opportunity. I mean literally because you have to go back to the uh sort of early to mid 2000s to uh to find yields at the level that they are now. So it's been you know for many many years investors were um pretty much starved of income from the bond market. I mean you you know 10-year yields were well below 1% at one point. um investors were having to take on quite a bit of risk whether that was credit or or volatility risk or what have you just to generate income. Now um you know we have a yield curve that that is actually back to to reasonably historical levels. I mean we have roughly 80% of the bond market um you know is well above 4%. So it's it's a it's a great time to get back into the bond market and the uh you know the market itself is providing you with a traditional income um advantage and fixed income which you know honestly has been absent for about a decade. So it is it is a really uh good opportunity for our investors. Yeah Steve Steve I like both of you I like to say it's it's an incredible time to be alive these days for many different reasons. So that's definitely one of them. uh you know, Steve, amidst the recent market volatility, how have you seen bond ETFs respond to that? Yeah, and this is uh kind of a common um question and it's it's a very topical um discussion. You know, if you go all the way back to the financial crisis, I think there were concerns then that, you know, the ETF structure had not been tested because at that time, although it was, you know, obviously an an incredibly volatile event at that time, they were too small, didn't have, you know, many assets or or many investors. And so, it was sort of written off as, oh, you know, they haven't been tested. There have been a number of episodes over, you know, the past 15 years um where you have seen volatility. Again, the knock was always, well, that wasn't a real stress test. I think, you know, you got something in 2020 that actually was quite a real stress test where you saw investment grade and even the Treasury market um you know, come under stress with COVID um that spring of 2020, which honestly we all want to forget. Um but it did happen. Um that was the first, you know, major um I think stress test and then, you know, the the products proved uh to be remarkably resilient. Then we had another uh decent one here in April um you know with um you know with the tariff announcements and the response was that bond ETFs traded in record volumes. I mean I think we saw on a single day right around the announcement um the liberation day announcements um you know bond ETFs trade something like a hundred billion which was well above their their prior record and so you know that's pretty remarkable. individual high yield ETFs as an example, you know, traded um in aggregate more than the actual over-the-counter high yield market. Um HY I think traded 60% of the high yield market. So it was it was quite an impressive thing just to see how investors did turn to these products during volatility. Um and were able to navigate risk because of of their their ability to use these products. I don't I know co was five years ago, but it feels like it was a million years ago. So let's let's forget about that and not let that happen again. Yeah. We'll keep that in the rear view. Yes, please. Uh, Michael, let me go back to you. I I want I wonder, are you concerned with interest rates and what solutions are available right now? Yeah. So, I think everybody has this belief that we're going to get interest rate cuts, right? It it just it seems like we keep pushing it out. We keep pushing it out, but we do have a lot of elements out there that suggest inflation is not gone. Um, and so I do think there's still a lot of risk at the longer duration end of the the spectrum. we we don't know if we're really going to get tariffs or not get tariffs like you know I see headlines today that China's talking to us again and this and that and so um one of the more innovative solutions that uh one of our clients we have a client Folio Beyond they have a fund called Riser Ris um and essentially it's a negative duration fund with a yield so it yields somewhere between six and eight percent but has a negative 10 duration the way it's structured using um um mortgage back uh IO's. Um so it's a really cool way to diversify a fixed income portfolio. It's a great pair to longer duration assets, right? You know, if you want that yield that a TLT from BlackRock is throwing off, but you want to cut that duration, pairing it with something like a riser is a great way to hedge out that potential interest rate hikes or things along those lines that I mean, we've actually seen rates rise without hikes, right? just in response to things. So, I like that solution as a portfolio kind of hedger or or diversifier within fixed income. I don't think there's anything else like it out there. Yeah, Mike, I would say on your point about hedging, I mean, that's an important strategy these days, especially like, you know, Stephen and you guys have both talked about the tariffs, the current economic environment, the supply, there's so many things going on. Hedging is a really important thing to to worry about right now, right? Absolutely. like we have an uncertain market like like um the bounce off the April call it liberation day has been amazing but we really haven't gotten any clarity um right so it's it's the most hated uh rally in history right um like the COVID bounce like I know we were joking we don't want to go back and remember that but I remember buying bond funds at 15% discounts in COVID and I remember buying Bitcoin at like $3,600 in COVID those were good days so Um um you know it was a bad year. So there's there was some good harvesting going on though. So yeah, it was uh I was betting Australian uh horse racing like two in the morning during co so I should have been focused on what you guys were doing. Uh Steve, let me go back to you. In your opinion, what do you think it is that attracts investors to the ETF rapper versus other investment products? Yeah. And I think um it's very interesting to me um as as a you know kind of dinosaur bond guy um just just this idea of of modernizing the bond market I think is something that that's almost comical when you say it out loud. Um I think folks in the bond market recognize that. But I think the good thing is you know the ETF rapper has actually done that in many respects and and albeit kicking and screaming because the bond market really doesn't want to be modernized. Um I do think the ETF rapper has brought a number of benefits to bond investors and and look you know equity investors right find find tremendous utility in the ETF structure and and if you compare equities versus bonds you would think that well you know you could trade equities on exchange you know how how much more value is with is there with an ETF rapper well there is it's that much more valuable with bonds you trade bonds over the counter still yeah you can trade them electronically but largely it's it's it's often a bilateral um voice driven market. Um it's opaque, it's expensive, it's fragmented. Um and what bond ETFs have done um they brought transparency, they've brought they brought standardization and and uh they brought tremendous cost efficiency um to um to everyday investors. So whether you're a large pension fund or you're an individual investor, you know, you could put together a very robust portfolio um using bond ETFs. Even if you have a small, you know, amount of proceeds to put to work, you can using bond ETFs effectively scale into hundreds or thousands of uh of bond exposures using the rapper. So, you know, it it's brought um a lot of benefits and and again, even to large investors, we've seen um you know, large institutional investors really embrace this product um even though they can trade uh individual bonds or or or derivatives more easily than individual investors. And the reasons are are the same. They're liquid. They're they're cheap. Um they're they're efficient to trade. And so I think investors of all types and sizes have really recognized that. Perfectly said. Mike, same question to you. What do you think is that attracts investors to the ETF rapper, you know, right now versus other investment products? Look, the the greatest thing about the ETF rapper is its ability to democratize assets, right? like um somebody with $1,000 just starting out who's, you know, just learned about the FIRE movement or something and they want to, you know, start to to plan their things out, they they can't buy a bond, right? It could be a par of 100K, things like that. But in an ETF rapper, they could buy a fractional share of the A or the TLT or whatever, right? And it just gives the the tools to people. It's it's a it's been a life-changing technology, the ETF structure, and it's tax efficiency. It's transparency. I I just love the culture of it, right? Um I I just I've I've dedicated my life to helping people launch, grow, and operate ETFs, and it's it's been rewarding because the structure itself culturally aligns with people as opposed to the the the old structures. One thing I would say though is when you put bonds into an ETF, the structure changes a little bit. Meaning if you buy a bond and you hold it to maturity, you get par like 99% of the time, right? If you got high quality, it doesn't really work that way when you put it into an ETF structure because you're kind of either lading or you're targeting a duration. That duration can change. You actually kind of have a kind of a perpetual maturity. So, it's not like like a savings bond where you buy it and someday it's worth this, right? Like it's going to move, right? and we've all seen the volatility in the um in the longer duration stuff out there. Um that led us to do when I mentioned the fire movement earlier. We actually built an ETF fund of funds of all of our clients ETFs designed to target a specific yield and not fluctuate as much. So, we're combining things like I said earlier, the YieldMax or the Risers or some of Black Rockck's ETFs into a fund that's designed to kind of target that 4% yield that the fire folks all like to have. So, that's our FIR fund. Sorry a little bit, Steve. No, no, sorry, Mike. I use your ETFs, too. There's another interesting um there's another interesting um way to do that. And, you know, we we pioneered this structure called Ibonds, which is a defined maturity structure. Now again, you know, it's it's not going to be exactly the same because you have a little bit of variability between the distributions and the final payment, but it does, you know, allow investors who really want to see that that behavior of of something rolling down the curve and maturing. That's kind of an in between. So it allows you to Yeah. So it allows you to, you know, basically target a specific maturity or ladder. Um but but it gives you that sort of you know traditional experience and it's kind of the you know the in between step between a traditional bond and a bond ETF. But this is the point you know innovation um in the rapper has really you know tried to match all of these different needs. Absolutely. Yeah. I love that you guys are using each other's stuff. It's a community up here right it's a kumbaya moment. Steve let me go back to you in talking about you know bond ETFs and how they have evolved over the years. What opportunities do investors have now that you feel they didn't have 10 years ago? Yeah, and this is a natural progression. I mean, if you look at the way, you know, the equity ETF market has evolved. I mean, there there are some parallels there. Um, so you go from, you know, broad um, you know, very useful but blunt instruments to to more granular focused products. And we've seen that in different ways. So, you know, as an example, Mike was talking about um, hedging. you know, you now have a number of ETFs that are interest rate hedged or inflation hedged. You have um products that um offer enhanced income through covered call strategies, things like that. So, it's it's moved from, you know, just sort of the broad building blocks to much more um defined sort of payoff type of structures. Um you've also seen more granular cuts across maturity and sector um credit quality etc. So, it's kind of a parallel to what you've seen in the equity market. It makes sense. um you know and right now a number of those products haven't quite scaled but that's just a that's a function of time and I think we're going to see um you know gradually as as especially model portfolios get more sophisticated and more targeted you're going to see demand um you know for these more precise exposures. The other frontier of this right would be you know um asset classes that traditionally um you know would not necessarily have lent themselves um or at least people would think they wouldn't have lent themselves. So a great example would be bank loans. I mean if you think back um you know going go back 101 15 years um you know even high yield bonds there was a debate about that and I think you know that obviously um ended up being um you know being advantageous to investors but there was a debate over bank loans as well and I think you know there is now a broad discussion around privates and things like that. I just think you'll continue to see innovation and and evolution in the space and where where do you see see the bond ETF market going in let's say the next five years? Yeah, I mean I think look, we we've been on record projecting that the industry globally is going to hit six trillion by the end of the decade. Um, you know, you'll you'll see um you'll see rapid growth in between. I mean, we're we're high double digits, low 20s in in uh in growth every year. And so I think you're going to also see um a continued buildout of active ETFs. And so that's been sort of the the um you know the dynamic as of late are traditional active managers who may you know go back even five years may have been resistant to putting their strategy in an ETF because of concerns around transparency or or fear of of you know maybe um you know taking money away from from a similar mutual fund strategy. They've really embraced it and they've entered the space. So we've seen a lot of new providers come in um you know some of them traditional active managers who who before were only in the mutual fund space. Um, but now they're now they're launching ETFs and I think you're going to continue to see that. You're going to continue to see um new players entering with much more niche targeted offerings as well. So, it's just, you know, again, to Mike's point, you're you're you're seeing products and players come in that are really trying to, you know, um, fit investor needs um, as as they evolve. As my dad, the great Bob Dylan said, uh, the times they are changing, guys. That's for sure. Uh, Mike, back to you. You know, speaking of the times, they are changing. Uh the ESG movement, I know it's declined as of late. How has this affected fixed income? Yeah. So, I I I think that um the narrative on ESG, I mean, just the letters together didn't really make sense, right? Like there I think we all agree that companies should have good governance and we shouldn't like throw away the environment. But like you put the three together, it gets confusing and everybody all of a sudden said, \"Oh, let's just exclude a couple bonds.\" And I I don't think it worked with people. I think it went a little bit too far. It'll be rebranded. There will be people who want to invest with impact with with intention, with sustainability. I I do think that's there. And I actually think bond holders have more ability to affect things than stockholders, right? You just get that that you know, covenants are more powerful than a proxy vote once a year. Um so, uh so I do think there are some opportunities there. one of our clients, uh, Academy, which is a veteranowned, um, broker dealer and asset manager in San Diego, they have an actual mission to help veterans find jobs and finance and all that. And, um, they launched an ETF with us, VETZ, that owns home loans and small business loans to veterans. So, it actually has a real impact, right? You're actually helping that market get liquidity, get assets to help that community. I think the future of ESG is more specific, right? Right. To an actual group and the issues that are there for that group and this is just a good example of that. I think that broad-based let me not own some Exxon bonds. I don't think that's really the future anymore. Yeah, it makes it makes a lot of sense. Steve, when you look at Black Rockck, how how does BlackRock think about innovation right now in the ETF rapper, which I know is a big point of discussion in a lot of different areas. Yeah. And and I was I was alluding to this a little bit earlier and and this it's a very um you know um I think robust uh debate across the industry which is you know what what are the limits of this wrapper? What should go in it? What should not and that you know you have to I think be credible in that some things may not belong in the wrapper um you know certain illquid assets might be better served in an interval structure or things like that. So I think it's really about you know the way we view it is from an end investor standpoint will the investor get the exposure um that they believe they'll get can we deliver that in a way um that will you know if it's an index fund will it track right if it's an active fund will it will we be able to use instruments within that wrapper effectively to deliver that exposure so that investors feel like they got what they were expecting and it's you know whether it's you know in credit or whether it's these more you define payout structures using um you know options or or or what have you. I mean that's kind of question one. Will the investor experience be what they were really really expecting when when they bought the product? Um a part of that too is market quality. Um how will a product given what it holds, how will it trade on exchange, how will market makers um view that product and and manage risk um in the event of a disruption. You know now we've had plenty of those, right? I mean it's it's common now you know to see these really really strong swings um you know across risk assets and and treasuries alike and so you know you really want to look at that closely um you can launch a very very clever strategy but if you look closely at the holdings and and you know the market maker community is not comfortable um taking that risk if you have a large disruption you don't want to see you know very very large um you know swings and premiums and discounts etc. So, it's kind of all the above and you know, we just sort of think of it under the general term responsible innovation. I mean, that seems like an obvious straightforward thing, but it does get back to that for sure. Michael, same same thing to you. When you look at title, how do you think about innovation in the ETF space, the ETF rapper space right now? Yeah, I mean, the ETF industry has had a boom in that we've had really good regulations, right? 611 the ETF rule and the 18F4 the VAR rule that opened the gates to all kinds of things and um I feel there's so much that can be done within the liquid world that I don't know why people are so obsessed with the illquid world you know um I I fine private credit's great keep it in something that's illquid because it is illquid or keep it under 15% in your ETF portfolio we have like we also um on our platform support block the the largest blockchain ETF. We've owned private credit in there multiple times. We just didn't make a big story about it because it was less than 15% of the portfolio and it worked out great. We owned the private credit of Core Scientific which went bankrupt, right? So all the equity holders got wiped out. Us as private creditors, we made out really, really well. So I think the rules are set pretty good. I think they'll continue to stretch them, but until private credit gets more liquid, I don't think it really needs to be more than 15% of an ETF per the rules. And I do think the way to get it more liquid is probably tokenization, which Black Rockck's probably figuring out right now. So, um, I think that's where we're going. No, it makes a lot of sense. And you know, Steve, going back to you, it's as we talked about, obviously, this the title of this event is ETF Revolution and things are are changing and and you know, you keep saying dinosaur bond guy. You're you seem very modern to me, by the way. But it's it's one of these things where what do you think, you know, the people watching today because we're we're so lucky to have, you know, you and Michael today and and obviously all these different great guests that come from all these different areas that are kind of coming together to help people invest and make money and and be successful. What do you think a common misconception might be whether it's in the the bond ETF space or crypto whatever it is what do you think from your end a common misconception is about ETFs right now because people are excited it is a revolution but there's still some skepticism yeah and it's a couple flavors I mean I think we talked about this um in earlier in the conversation just fears of what will happen in dislocated markets and you know I I think our view is that you know the last few years um have really provided a number of test points on that and and and it's our view that the the the structure has proven um it its resilience and its ability to weather um you know these types of storms. The other thing I I do think there's um a misperception around um you know for lack of a better way to put it um some kind of a alchemy type of thing where oh you know once you once you you know for example put bonds in a bond ETF um all of a sudden bonds aren't going to behave like bonds anymore. Um and you know Mike talked about this a little bit. I mean you they will behave like bonds. Um it is a portfolio of bonds and so you know they will behave um just as the underlying portfolio does in terms of of you know rates rising or spreads widening or narrowing or or what have you. Um it's it's kind of like the the basic northstar is the portfolio is is what drives the behavior. There's not some weird thing that happens just because you you know put bonds inside the wrapper and allow them to trade on exchange. it doesn't change the basic character of the fact that you're holding bonds. Um now again you know to to Mike's point um in the traditional structure you know that ends up looking like a perpetual ladder um because you know bonds inside the wrapper mature you reinvest the proceeds you know back into the index and so you hold that over 101 15 years it may have roughly the same duration but that would be the same as just lading a portfolio over and over and over again and so um I think that's just the the real thing is that some investors just really um you know really think that there's some kind of wild transformation information. There's not it's it's a bond portfolio that trades on exchange effectively. Perfectly said. Mike, same same thing to you. I mean, what do you see? Uh you guys are both titans of industry, so you have the great knowledge base. What do you think are the kind the misconceptions you're seeing on your end? Um I think people like look at ETFs and think that you can just stick anything in them, right? I mean, you know, our website is designed, it's got a little button at the top that says build your ETF, right? because that's what we do. We help people come to this market. I've had people pitch me, can I put sneakers in an ETF? Can I put diamonds in an ETF? Like um it it's uh one guy wanted to do something with GameStop. I mean, you just hear crazy ideas. It's not it's it's a rapper based on a law that was built in 1940. It's a law all about disclosure and protections of investors. It's not designed to just take something illquid and make it liquid. So like um I I think people need to remember it's still a financial traditional finance thing even though it's probably the best rapper in that world. I'm a big sports gambling guy and building your own I've seen that one too. Yeah. Can can we get parlays into an ETF? An ETF parlay. Well listen I I can't thank you both enough. This has been a fascinating discussion. Before I let you go back to you, Steve, talk about, you know, what you see next for Black Rockck. What are you looking to do in the next, let's see, you know, year, two years, five years. What's the the future hold for Black Rockck? Yeah. Again, we're on a journey um you know, in in in fixed income ETFs. I mean, we're we're we're 2% of the bond market. We meaning the industry. And I and I think that, you know, we're we're on our way to um you know, to increasing that substantially. Um, and I think it's it's a combination of of responsible innovation. It's it's really helping clients understand the benefits that that this rapper brings to them um in their portfolio. It's it's making sure that, you know, we're meeting investor needs as far as, you know, what active strategies do they want in this rapper um for for their their portfolio construction. And then also, you know, one one thing we didn't touch on is just this idea that um you know, we often get asked, well, is it better to go active or index and fixed income? Our answer is yes. It's both. They work together. Um they play a complimentary role. So, I think that's um that's the message is that, you know, we want to make sure investors know how to use the products. We're giving them the products they want and the right quality. No, it's beautifully said and and you know, it's been it really is, you know, Stephen, it's one of these times that I think don't you feel like this is like a just a precipice type moment where, you know, whether it was when computers first became something and the obviously the dot stuff and now we're, you know, you're seeing crypto, but it seems like ETFs are just at this really kind of beautiful time and point where things could really get forward in in the next little while. Yeah, I I I agree. I mean it look it's a very uh it's a it's a very elegant um structure. It it has you know very clearly brought um an enormous amount of benefits to investors. Um you know as Mike said it's helped democratize I mean that's a term we use a lot. Um, and I go back to this idea that whether you're an individual investor with not a huge amount of proceeds to put to work or whether you're a large pension um, official institution or what have you, you know, this product has proven that it adds value and and I think, you know, it's it's a very exciting time, you know, and there's it's possible the rapper itself may evolve over time, whether that's, you know, maybe regulatory changes or or changes to the to the mechanics of the structure or what have you. I think it is a really really exciting time um you know to to be part of this industry. Yeah, as I said it's it's quite the time to be alive. And you know as you you were alluded to earlier like this dinosaur dinosaur bond guy. You seem pretty modern to me, Steve. That's for sure. And oh I'm I'm reformed. I think that's the way I look at it. Well, that's you that's why you guys do you you know an incredible job at Black Rockck. And I think we might have lost Michael. I apologize because it was very emotional to have you guys both here today. But this is I think why it's so important to to talk with people like you, Steve, to talk with people like Mike because you guys, you know, and I don't use this term lightly. You are titans of industry and what you do. And I think that there's a lot of people watching that, you know, and I appreciate the answer to the question about people that are skeptical. It's they really want to get involved, but they need to hear from someone like you that is so knowledgeable to give them that trust. And have you seen that in with what you've dealt with in recent years where there's people that obviously you know understand what's going on and they don't have any confidence issues but being able to talk to them and explain what you guys do at Black Rockck or Michael what he does at Title that they really they feel so much more comfortable with getting involved in ETFs and and looking forward. I think um you know what we saw and and again not to bring up this 2020 time frame but it is a great example. Um we we up until that point I think um we continue to have you know a fair amount of skepticism um you know would these products and in particular bond ETFs really stand up to a powerful stress test and you know March February March 2020 was certainly that as we discussed what we saw after that was was astonishing. we saw um you know institutions and and you know personally some some of which I had been talking to for for a long time um who you know basically were saying yeah we're still a little concerned about what might happen if this scenario occurred or or you know um just pick pick your you know multiple choice there but um after that we saw a number of uh of these formerly skeptical clients come off the sidelines you know pick up the phone um how do I get involved how do I use these products, how do I trade them the right way? Um, and it was it was a sea change, I think, in thinking about, you know, how how these products can actually instead of being afraid of them in in difficult markets, how you can actually use them to navigate difficult markets and that was that was a tremendous change. So you know it does take um I think you know different investors need to see different proof points over time uh to get comfortable and you know we'll just keep working at that um whether it's education um you know helping investors understand uh the exposures and or how to trade them. Perfectly said like today that really helped that. So can't thank you enough Steve Aly global co-ed of fixed income ETFs for Black Rockck. Thank you so much for your time and Michael Venino of course co-founder and CIO of title as well. Really a fascinating forum discussion. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks for having me. The honor and pleasure was all mine. And next up is a panel on something both so relevant and prevalent in today's society. How ETFs can capture the AI boom. Please join me in welcoming in Jay Jacobs, US head of thematic and acting ETFs for Black Rockck and Avana Delvesca, the founder and CIO of Spear Invest. It's so wonderful to be both of you today on such a nice and beautiful day. Pleasure to Thanks for having us then. Of course, it's great to be with you, Jay. Let me start with you. Where do you Jay currently see the most opportunity in markets? Well, I think what's kind of appearing this year is that this is really a thematic driven market. You go back to some of the sell-off tantrum around deep seat. You've seen a lot of the reactions to tariffs and geopolit geopolitics this year. This year is not a story of sectors. Sectors doesn't effectively capture things like geopolitics and AI. This is not a story necessarily of things like industries or even countries. This isn't this is a market being driven by themes. I think this really is going to change the way that people think about how they build their portfolios in 2025 and beyond. You absolutely can still build a portfolio using core building blocks to get your kind of long-term lowcost lower turnover strategies. But if you're looking to play the way that the market is evolving today, you have to consider themes like AI and geopolitics as important uh niche corners of the market to find opportunities as well as to avoid some of the risks out there. No, for sure. It's like this. It is an incredible time to be alive, especially with what AI is going to be doing. Anna, let me go over to you. Can you tell us your view about AI ETFs and maybe name some of your favorite AI ETFs? Could you repeat that question? Sorry, I you cut off them for a second. Oh, no, no problem. I I just I was wondering if you could tell us about your view about AI ETFs and also maybe name some of your favorites as well. Absolutely. So, I can't really speak of my favorite ETFs, but I'll tell you my view. I think when it comes to AI, there is a lot of changes that are happening in front of us and therefore they're creating a lot of winners and losers. So if you look at the mega cap stocks for example, that's what everybody is focused on right now. They're not going to be the stocks of the future. So you really, in my opinion, need to be a little bit more balanced and look for what are going to be the winners of tomorrow. So what we do is we invest actively. So we manage a hedge fund-l like strategy and and what that means is that we try to pick 20 companies that we think will lead will lead in the next wave of AI at any given time. So we're really also focused on valuation and we're really trying to kind of find more idiosyncratic opportunities rather than themes which Jay Jay talked about which is a completely different way of uh of doing it. Sure. And and Jay back to you. What what themes are you excited about? Well, I hinted at it a little bit. I think one is artificial intelligence. So, this is this shouldn't be a surprising piece of it, right? AI's been around uh for a while. In November 2022, you saw Chad GBT came out and it was really kind of that iPhone moment for artificial intelligence. I think what investors have to think about though is not whether AI is a good theme or a bad theme. I think most people agree AI is a big powerful theme. It's how do you access it? And one of the ways that we think that you should access the AI theme is by looking at the entire value chain. It's not just about the mag seven companies. Yes, they have a lot of money. They're investing very heavily in AI. Some of them are developing some of the largest most powerful large language models. But if you look across the value chain of AI, there's a few different layers of what we're calling the AI tech stack where there's opportunity. At the bottom, you you have a very foundational layer of digital infrastructure. AI doesn't just happen in thin air. There's literal physical real estate that has access to power that is storing semiconductors that has tons of compute that has security that's located near city centers where there's a lot of AI demand. This has become very valuable in this massive build out of artificial intelligence. So the digital infrastructure layer is really important. On top of that you have data owners. So that can be social media companies that have a lot of language data. That could be healthcare companies that have a lot of healthcare data. that has become really valuable in the age of AI because data is really the fuel powering a lot of these AI platforms. Now above that you have large language models themselves. These are obviously some of the most powerful uh AI software in the market today. That's where companies like the Mag 7 are very um important. Uh but even beyond the large language models you have applications that are adopting artificial intelligence that are becoming smarter, more powerful, more valuable to their customers. Think about, you know, if uh your streaming service does a better job recommending your next TV show, you're likely to watch more TV and spend more money on that streaming uh service. So, the applications that are adopting AI are an important part of the value chain as well. So, when we look at the in summary, when we look at the AI theme, it's really about looking across the entire value chain. This is not just a MAG7 play. We really like to look at it across uh those different parts of the tech stack. And that's where an ETF that's investing across the value chain like ARDI from myshares ARTY is really giving people a one ticker solution to be able to play across that diversified basket of stocks. Absolutely. Anna, let me uh go back to you and obviously we know there's a lot of stuff going on around the world. From your perspective, how are you navigating the geopolitical risks such as obviously USChina tech tensions which disproportionately impact the obviously the semiconductor and networking supply chains which of course are so important to AI. Well, absolutely uh Dan there is a lot of geopolitical risk but really what is important for people to keep in mind that it's really fundamentals that are driving these stocks and this industry. So when people sell based on geopolitical concerns, at the end of the day, if you need data centers, if you need to build out the infrastructure, whether there is uncertainty or not, this is going to happen regardless. So I think that's something that really got lost in the first half where people panicked out of a lot of high quality stocks and that's really what we tried to capture some of these uh these dislocations. And to build on Jay's point, I think it's very important not to be invested across the at least for us, we try not to be AC invested across the board to get exposure, but to really find the best companies. And here's an example. Large language models for example is a very competitive space. That's not going to be the winner because basically these companies need to keep investing money to get back to ground zero essentially. So we're really trying to find areas where uh where really the the value will be created but also captured by that company and similar example are give applications. There's a lot of applications but they're also very competitive. So it's a very competitive space. It's not easy to build a killer application. So you really need to find the company that can come up with a winner captures all scenario or or able to capture a large share of the market. So I think what what is important for investors not to get bogged down by the macro because at the end of the day if you find the companies that will generate and capture value you will do uh well over time. No it's such a smart strategy and Jay back to you how do you feel you know geopolitical forces are affecting markets right now? Well it's you know maybe the second or or first most impactful theme in markets this year next to artificial intelligence. Uh there's a couple of ways that we see this playing out. You know, one is you're seeing increased tech competition around the world. So it's not just about US technology, it's about US technology, technology in Europe, technology in Asia. Um and that's putting pressure on the tech sector because what I think a lot of investors don't realize is US tech gets 60% of its revenue from overseas. So the more geopolitical pressure you have on the tech sector, that can actually be a significant headwind for some of those major tech names. So one strategy is stay in tech but really try to focus on the companies that have more domestic revenue uh that hire more domestically that produce more domestically to try to reduce some of that geopolitical risk. I think the second thing we have to look at in the tax space, sorry, in the geopolitical sphere is as you see more reshoring efforts, which could be through the lens of tariffs, could be through the lens of um policies supporting domestic uh production uh like the infrastructure investments and jobs act of 2021. Um it's not just about building more stuff in America, building more products. You also need the infrastructure to support it. You don't just kind of build a building and say start building semiconductors. You need a lot of power. You need a lot of water. You need uh you need freight. Uh you need you know you know the easy access to transportation. And so I think what's been a little bit overlooked from a geopolitical perspective is as we reshore in America, we have to invest in infrastructure alongside that. Now, infrastructure is a great theme, but it's also a great portfolio tool because it tends to be more defensive, tends to be lower volatility than the market, and tends to have built-in inflation protection. We really like infrastructure as this kind of growth theme that actually behaves a little bit more like value stocks. And then I think the third thing that you have to look at in geopolitics is we are seeing more risk out there from uh geopolitical conflict. Whether that's impacting things like defense stocks, whether that's impacting things like cyber security names, it's happening both in the physical and digital world. Uh so we believe if if you want to kind of build the def you know the defensiveness in your portfolio not through a volatility perspective but really the importance of defense around the world um cyber security names in in our IHAC ETF or actually our recently launched IDEF ETF IDEF is an active way of looking across the defense industry of who's really kind of um playing in the space where you're seeing increased spending and global shifts around where defense spending is uh is happening. Yeah, that's perfectly said. Avana, back to you. We all know that right now, uh, AI compute demand is surging. I mean, it's it's crazy. Where do you see the most compelling hardware opportunities? GPUs, networking, memory, or something maybe further down the stack like cooling or power system. I was just in uh Toronto for a conference and I was looking at all these ways they're cooling the data centers. It's it really is fascinating. There's so many things going out there. How do you see that? So, absolutely. Then I think the opportunities are across the entire hardware layer. So chips got particularly uh hard hit uh or the data center trade in general got very hard hit in the first half. So we really found a lot of opportunities there. Smaller caps especially on the networking side was really where where the carnage was. So this is where we picked up a lot of good ideas on the selloff and uh and these would be companies that are really critical to the new launches that that Nvidia uh um I think um stocks like for example in the power gen space got really hard hit uh while they're actually beneficiaries of um uh the reshoring uh the reshoring investment. So uh I think across the board uh I would say networking just because of the market caps and the higher beta is where we found the most opportunities uh in the first half but we're invested across the board. No, it's it's it really is. It's amazing. You definitely explained that beautifully and you know van I know AI is driving innovation across multiple sectors from of course semiconductors to cloud to healthcare. How do you think ETF issuers define and construct sector exposure when building these AI themed ETFs which of course are you know the title of our event today's ETF revolution. It's a revolution. Yes. So absolutely. So different people have different approaches and they're all sound very uh very interesting and compelling. Our strategy is is hedge fun like very much the the investment and research sty style is um is very similar to the way you would invest in a hedge fund and basically what it means is you have a divine defined um universe of about 120 names and out of those you select the 20 that you want to be invested in. So in my view that's really the best way to invest and our ETF is called SPRX for for those that are not uh that are not familiar but there are other different ways to invest too. Our ETF is particularly higher risk because of its concentration. So it's really um it's really good for people that can take a longer term view. I think if you want to be more diversified I think some of the the names that Jay brought uh brought uh brought up sound uh uh sound very interesting. So it's all about people figuring out what is the level of risk that they want to take and then allocating uh allocating um respectively. Sure. No, it makes it makes perfect sense. And you know Jay, when you think about where we're at today, where investors are at today and as obviously AI becomes so much more prevalent, what do you think one thing investors need to know today about where things are and where things could be going? Well, I think number one, we're still very much in the early stages of artificial intelligence. As we think about kind of the timeline of AI, we're still in what we call the build phase. It's a lot of money being spent on capex to be able to build all the digital infrastructure to support the larger adoption of artificial intelligence. So, today we're in the build stage. I think next we're going to be in the enterprise adoption stage. That's where companies and governments are going to be willing to spend a lot of money bringing AI software into their businesses either to make their products better or to make their employees more efficient. That's when you'll see a big shift in where the money is being made in AI. So today, a lot of that money is being made in semiconductors and kind of that infrastructure layer, but in the enterprise adoption stage, more likely in the large language model space and in the data space. Um, but finally, you know, there's really going to be kind of the um AI revolution stage. This is where you're going to see kind of widespread adoption of AI, brand new products, and even brand new industries being built using artificial intelligence, companies that maybe have barely even been conceived of yet. I think that's kind of the third and final stage of of artificial intelligence. This mirrors what we've seen with things like smartphones, right? Where kind of initially you saw uh you know maybe more of the 4G infrastructure benefiting from it from smartphones. Then you started to see kind of the smartphone platform manufacturers make a lot of money and then you saw kind of new industries like mobile social media, mobile e-commerce, uh you know uh ride share really popping up only because those other components had already uh been built and scaled. So I think AI is going to follow kind of a similar trajectory going forward. We're still very much in the early innings uh of this revolution. Yeah, it's just the beginning of the ball game so far, right? Maybe the second innings. Uh Avano, same same to you. You know, what do you think is one thing that investors should know today? Yeah, so I think Jay summarized it really well. I think one thing that I would say is that things are going a little slower than what people expect. And what I mean by that is that this year everybody was like, \"Okay, well, are we there yet? Are we done with the hardware trade?\" Not really. Like this is going to be a multi-year just to build out the hardware infrastructure that we need. It's going to take 10 years. So, we're really looking at exactly what what Jay said, but step one may be actually 10 plus years and then step two may be um starting in five years and following that. So, I think that's one thing for investors to keep in mind that this is going to be a multi-year opportunity. It's not going to be all going in a straight line, right? Because there are winners and losers and even on the on the hardware side, but specifically on the application side, they're going to be companies that are going to get disrupted, right? So, um I think there's going to be a lot of opportunities, but I think investors should be patient and be able to hold through uh pullbacks and um and consolidations. That's well said. Uh well, listen, amazing stuff for you both. Before I let you go though, and I can't thank you enough for joining us today to be part of this event. Jay, back to you. What's next for Black Rockck? Take us a year ahead, two years ahead, five years ahead. Well, I think what we're going to see is just a continuation of very theme-driven market. You know, I think the influence of things like geopolitics, of artificial intelligence. We even haven't we haven't even talked about demographics and aging populations and developed markets and the impact that means on people's portfolios. So, my underlying message to investors is twofold. One, keep an eye on themes. I think increasingly markets are going to be driven by these themes. Second though, I think people have to be nimble in how they're allocating to these themes. Now, we've brought out a product uh tickers throw tro. It's a thematic rotation ETF and very dynamically can allocate from a across a variety of different themes. Right now, one of the themes it really likes is uh companies that are at the intersection of uh customer uh consumers tightening their belt, more kind of recessionary type of consumer companies, but that are also not tariffs sensitive. This is kind of a unique basket of companies where if you think about consumer staples being more defensive but also very kind of uh susceptible to tariffs. We're not just looking at it through the sector lens. We're looking at the companies that are not going to be as susceptible to tariff risk as well. So uh throw is a really dynamic way to look at themes in the market that can help people be more tactical in how they allocate to themes. Love it. Avana to you. What's next for Spear and Best? What what do you see happening to this incredible time to be alive? Well, I mean, for us, it's really like we have one fund and that's what we we're really focused on to to uh uh deliver Alpha. I think there's going to be amazing opportunities across uh across the board. I think it's going to be very important for people to understand what they're getting themselves into. So, I think I can't really stress uh that enough, but I think there's there's going to be a lot of um a lot of uh opportunity coming ahead as a result of uh as a result of AI. Love it. Jay Jacobs, US head of thematic and active ETFs for BlackRock and Delvesa, founder and CIO of Spirit Invest. Thanks again so much to both of you for joining me for such a wonderful discussion today. Thank you. Thanks. Great to have them both. And now I'm really fired up for our next panel as we continue along in the ETF revolution. How innovation is redefining investor portfolios. Next up, how active and passive strategies work together with David Botset, head of innovation and stewardship for Schwab asset management and Chris Murphy, the head of ETF specialist for T-roll price. Had a chance to catch up with David and Chris earlier. Here's our discussion. One and all. I'm Dan Leech and I'm very excited to welcome in David Botset, head of innovation and stewardship at Schwab Asset Management and Chris Murphy, head of ETF specialists at Troll Price. A lot of you in the audience know Troll Price as a longtime leader in the realm of actively managed funds. While Schwab is one of the biggest names in index investing, we're thrilled to bring these two industry leaders together to help everyone watching understand the roles that active and passive strategies can play in a portfolio. We're going to dig into how active and passively managed ETFs can complement each other when one approach makes sense over the other and how investors can combine them to achieve their objectives. Before we dive in, David and Chris would love if you could take a moment to introduce yourselves and share a bit more about your role. David, let's start with you. Thanks so much, Dan. It's great to be here today and looking forward to the discussion with with Chris and yourself. As you said, my name is David Botset. I'm the head of innovation at Schwab Asset Management. Now, at Schwab Asset Management, we are a $1.4 trillion asset manager, and we're thinking about innovation all the time. But one of the things at the heart of everything we do is also trying to make investing less complex for investors. They have a very straightforward way to implement the strategies within their portfolios to help them meet their objectives. I think that's best illustrated when you look at our the Schwab ETF lineup. We have the fifth largest lineup of ETFs based on AUM in the industry today and we've done that with the just a little over 30 ETFs. So very successful in what we've delivered and looking forward to the discussion today. Thanks so much David. Really happy to have you here as well. Chris let's move over to you. Sure. Thanks Dan and thank you Benzig community for joining. Um Tim as you mentioned I'm head of ETF specialist here at Troll Price. I've spent my entire career believe it or not in the ETF industry. So, um, feel like I could share a wide range of perspectives and certainly talk about the the massive growth that this industry has experienced over these 15 plus years that I've been involved. Um, at Troll Price, we offer 19 ETFs. We began our ETF journey back in 2020, uh, and currently have about 15 billion in assets. So, it's been a, uh, it's been a fun, quick, and exciting ride over the past couple years. and uh we're just getting started and happy to discuss the growth of active ETFs, the use cases of active ETFs with you and the community here today. Yeah, it's a heck of a time to be alive, that's for sure. Wonderful to have you both. And with that, I'm going to jump right in. David, let me start with you. How can investors effectively blend active and passive strategies within a single portfolio to optimize returns and manage their risk? You know, Dan, I'm glad you asked the question in that way about blending active and passive strategies because it's something that that we think about regularly and we talk to investors at Schlab about it on a on a regular basis. I think there are three things that we think about when we talk about blending active and passive strategies. It's first and foremost starting with the objective, the investment objective and timeline of the investor. Secondly is cost and third what is risk tolerance. So let me touch on on each of those components a little bit more. First on the investment objective and timeline. I think this is the starting point of any conversation with an investor is understanding what they're trying to achieve. Are they saving for retirement? They saving for a house down payment. Are they saving for child's education? that is very important in understanding uh what they're trying to achieve and how that blend may come together as well as the timeline because that timeline is very much tied to that investment objective. The second is cost. You know cost is very important in helping you achieve your investment objectives over time. Some investors are willing to bear a bit more cost in trying to achieve those objectives where others really want to squeeze every single dollar out of that cost that they can. So a very important consideration as well. And then thirdly is risk tolerance. You know we know passive strategies seek to track a benchmark. So when you open that statement every month or every quarter when you get it and you're investing in a passive strategy, uh it's going to correspond very highly to the market benchmarks that you regularly see when you you read the newspaper or you watch CNBC or or Bloomberg TV. um other investors are seeking that opportunity for outperformance and they have a little bit more tolerance for performance that differs from the benchmark. So that's another important considerations. And when you really start to blend all three of those components together, you start to get a picture of how you think about the weight between passive and active strategies within a portfolio. Now you lay that out there beautifully, David. And Chris, let's move over to you. How do you see it? Listen, active management has always played a role with investors portfolios and objectives. It's just what what's different now is you can access active management and what has become the the vehicle of choice via the ETF wrapper. And so, you know, historically, if if you're an investor that's primarily using ETFs, you've really only been given one option in terms of how to invest, and that's through either market cap weighted passive based ETFs or factor or or multiffactor ETFs that all track and index. But up until the last couple of years now, you have opportunities to uh express certain uh you know active management capabilities via the ETF wrapper that you hadn't had in the past. And so we think you know active has always played a role, but now that it's more accessible via the ETF wrapper, investors need to start considering kind of how to to your point blend those strategies together. what the time horizon is, uh what is the manager's objective of of that actively managed ETF and and how does that complement a market cap weighted or factor-based ETF strategy that might you've been historically using? And so I think now you almost have to both reunderwite your passive exposures or in other words scrutinize or or look at what those passive exposures are giving you and now what can you access via an actively managed ETF that can either complement or quite honestly replace that given a specific asset class might be more uh suitable for active management. In other words, maybe have more propensity to outperform in certain asset classes with active management given some inefficiencies of those asset classes. And so now that there's more options for investors to access active management in the vehicle of choice, you're starting to see a bit of a resurgence of of active management, a bit of a louder drum beat of of the benefits of active, how it can complement passive, but also how it can replace passive in certain pockets of the market. And those are the conversations we're having in and every day with investors. Yeah, I love it. And as you said, blending those two strategies, it really is a fascinating thing. Chris, let me stay with you and ask you, what asset classes or market conditions do you think tend to favor active strategies over passive ones and vice versa? Yeah, it's a good segue from that prior question, Dan, because you know, definitely zoning in on specific asset classes like I mentioned that have historically lent itself to active managers would be the first place to look naturally and and one of those pockets we think is in the small and midcap US equity markets. Um this is a a market cap that has if you just look at that Russell 1000 2000 for example has really deteriorated in its quality. In other words, you know over 45% or so of the index is in non-earners. So companies that aren't generating any any earnings revenue. And so you that one in and of itself I think is is a bit of a red flag for passive investing in in that asset class. Two analyst coverage. So how much uh you know attention essentially are small midcap stocks getting from Wall Street? Uh analyst coverage has has significantly declined in the small midcap space. So more opportunity to exploit inefficiencies from a bottom fundamental research platform like we have at T-Repp to find those next winners when the street aren't covering them to the to the extent they were several years ago. And then and then finally the the ability to to navigate different subsectors and industries within the small midcap space where we think active management is critical. Think of biotechnology, think of software and services. Uh certain asset classes or sorry subindustries where you really need to understand the the the trajectory of a specific company, it its goals, its management. uh we're active managers that are doing the boots on the ground fundamental research. Meeting with uh executives at those companies to understand the goals and and capital allocation strategies that they're employing really gives a leg up for for active management specifically in the small midcap space. again that's not trafficked heavily as much uh and where the index just isn't giving you maybe what you want from the exposure perspective and the ability to particularly outperform and find those new crop of winners uh that the index you know is going to own but not maybe own to the extent that it should. Uh so that would be one asset class that I would think of as is really ripe for active management now in the ETF wrapper at lower fee and more tax efficiency I think is a really compelling opportunity. Secondly, on the fixed income side, high yield is another asset class that that we think has really been underserved from an active management perspective in the ETF rapper. And clearly that's a that's an asset class in a category where we think credit research understanding the credits that you own uh or not own in particular is critical in these types of market environments to not necessarily drive particular how performance but really uh effectively navigate kind of the what could happen in a default scenario or any type of breaks in the credit market and not owning those companies that might be more susceptible to challenging environments. That's where active management really shines specifically in the high yield credit space. Uh and I think that's an area of the market that again has been underserved and and where active management tends to work and uh now being available in ETF rapper again is a really compelling asset class and strategy that investors should consider who want to venture into the high yield credit markets within US equity or within the US high yield space. Yeah, it's such an important information. That's why days like today are so important and why I'm so lucky to have both of you and and David, let me go over to you and ask you the same question about, you know, when you look at the asset classes or market conditions, they tend to favor the active strategy over passive ones and vice versa. How do you see it? I think we at Schwab Asset Management see it much the same way as Chris just talked about. Uh the the the the propensity for outperformance in different market segments, but I may frame it slightly different way. really thinking about the market efficiencies component is playing a role in strategic allocation decisions. So Chris Chris mentioned that the opportunity for potential small cap outperformance. The same could be said looking at domestic versus international where domestic equities are covered much more uh from a global perspective by analysts than international or emerging market uh equities. So you see many times in in the Schwab asset management strategic asset allocation models, we will tend to use more active strategies in international and emerging market equities in say our Schwab target date funds or the Schwab model portfolios than we will on the domestic equity side. There's also that market efficiencies in the ability to index certain segments of the market. Chris mentioned high yield. I would go to the ultrash short duration space. It's a it's a key critical component to many investors portfolios, but quite frankly it is a very challenging part of the market to develop an index that is representative of the exposure that you would get there. So we found that that is a segment that can often be tackled using actively managed strategies versus index strategies. That kind of gets to that strategic element. Then there's also a bit of a tactical uh and timing element. You look at different periods of time in the market where the dispersion of returns could be very narrow or broad benchmarks are really driven higher by a limited number of names. You look at 2024 where a limited number of names were driving many of the broad benchmarks. It made it really tough for active managers to outperform. So that's kind of a techn a a tactical component of consideration of saying in this market environment is there greater dispersion of returns to the extent there is that likely opens up more opportunities for active managers to outperform which may weigh on that balance between using passive and active in your portfolio. That's beautifully explained and David I want to go to you first here. A lot of people know, you know, passive investing is often touted for its low cost, but does that always translate to better performance over the long term and also how does active management management justify its fee structure today? Yeah. So, I think all else being equal, low cost will help drive greater returns. If we think about it just at the highest level when you look at many passive strategies especially domestic strategies that they may charge two, three or four basis points much like many of the Schwab index ETFs charge and you compare that to uh a a competing active strategy that may charge 40 50 60 basis points. you're already setting up a threshold of outperformance that is necessary for the active manager to deliver just to be equal with the passive strategy. That may be 40, 50, 60 basis points of outperformance to deliver on an annual basis just to be equal. It's a pretty high threshold, a pretty high bar for an active manager to deliver. So again it gets back to all else being equal. Yes. But there are those opportunities and especially in those less efficient market segments where active managers have a greater opportunity to outperform and you know on a costtoost basis it does it can make sense to look at a higher price active strategy when they've got a greater opportunity to outperform. Absolutely. And Chris how do you see that from the active perspective in your view? Yeah, I would agree with David that one of the key elements to when you look at active managers being able to outperform, you know, the first thing you can kind of speak to is is the cost of of that product in in that strategy. Um, but but you also need to consider kind of what you're getting for your your cost, right? Are you are you getting a a manager that is more of a closet indexer so to speak that isn't really truly adding value beyond the benchmark or or making you high conviction calls on specific stocks or sectors to generate a performance delta over that fee that is that is substantial enough to to outweigh that extra 40 basis points. So, you know, understanding kind of what the process, what the strategy is, and are are you getting what you're paying for, we think is critical. Um, you know, at Zero Price, we pride ourselves in in being very competitively priced across all of our ETFs. Um, and in in areas where, you know, we think we can add significant outperformance above that fee barrier that David mentioned. And so, you know, I think fees are important, but you also need to understand what am I getting for my fees? You know, at Tor Price, you're getting a global research platform with hundreds of analysts that are um tasked at knowing the companies that we're recommending and buying better than their management companies. So uh we think it's critical that you're getting what you're paying for and at your price we think you are you know being more more than compensated for the level of due diligence the level of scrutiny that we're putting on individual stock that we own in our portfolios uh and being stewards of that capital in a very efficient way uh in delivering performance that can be above that that fee gap that that David mentioned. You know, one thing I would say too is that, you know, fees are important, but they're not necessarily something that I think need to be as scrutinized as may they maybe have been in the past. You know, given that you can deliver outperformance that would significantly outweigh the benefit of going into a lower fee kind of commoditized beta exposure in that specific asset class where you know there's an opportunity cost I think associated for investors that they need to consider as well. And now that you've act have active strategies in all areas of the market across all different pockets of investors portfolios um there is opportunity for alpha to be had even if it comes at an extra 40 basis points. You know that 40 basis points we think could be totally outweighed over a long period of time if uh active management is done appropriately and effectively and we think that's what we deliver here at Price. So fees are important, but it shouldn't stop you from at least trying to discover some managers that can can deliver on those fees. For sure, man. We all like we all know clients love value. And Chris, let me stay with you. Clients also love wins. How do you measure success when integrating both approaches? Is it alpha generation like you mentioned, cost efficiency? Is it riskadjusted returns or something else? Yeah, that's kind of a loaded question, Dan, because it's really dependent on what your um your objectives are, right? If you're if you're putting together a portfolio on behalf of other clients or for yourself, uh you want to make sure that it's it's suitable for you and your objectives. And so, you know, active management can can really play a critical role in in a variety of ways, right? Alpha generation is purely, you know, the the primary objective is is to generate alpha above its benchmark or outperformance above its benchmark. Downside protection is another element that as you start to see more active ETFs come to market using derivatives. So whether that's futures or or options to deliver certain outcomes whether that's uh option premium income or downside protection. Uh active ETFs can play critical role in protecting and preserving principle uh in helping manage sequence of return risks for retirees manage those draw downs or tail risk events. Uh, and so it really depends on your objective, really depends on what your current portfolio looks like in terms of how to assess the really the benefits of active strategies in your current lineup of of portfolio uh of ETFs in your portfolio. Um, and it's really assessing kind of what you're paying for, but also what you're getting. Uh, and so we think it it's a variety of inputs to to assess what what's successful with with adding an active ETF into your portfolio. Um but it you know all that means is some extra homework for you and due diligence for you in terms of how that fits and thinking about asset allocation lesser around diversification of asset classes but diversification of strategies that you're blending together and how diversification across an active fundamental active equity ETF compare with a market cap compare with a a single factor ETF and provide you maybe smoother returns over time rather than just saying let's allocate to the large mid and small and international. It's it's a a diversification of investment strategies that we think is really a critical piece of asset allocation that might be um you know underutilized by investors today. Well, Chris, you answered the loaded question beautifully. Let's go over to David and see what he thinks when it comes to how you measure success integrating both approaches. You know, I I I agree much with what Chris said there. When you really think about it through the lens of the investor, are we helping investors achieve their desired outcome? And even if that desired outcome is something like retirement, that objective in the interim stages along the way change over the course of somebody's life. You know, if I'm a young investor coming in and I'm saving for retirement, I've got a long time horizon. I may be able to withstand more volatility in my portfolio and I may be able to sustain the swings a lot more than as I'm getting closer to retirement. And it's less about the significant upside opportunity and it's more about the downside protection that I'm trying to preserve in my portfolio. So getting back to what Chris said, it's not necessarily just about alpha or costs or risk adjusted returns. It's about understanding the desired outcome for that investor and helping to construct a portfolio that helps them meet that outcome and also the dynamic change of those outcomes um over the life of that objective that they're saving for. Same could be said if you're saving for a child's college education. you know, that dynamic of of what you're able to stomach and your expectations returns very different when your when your child is one year old versus a child that may be 17, 18 or in the midst of college where you know you can't you can't stomach that downside nearly as significantly. So that really can inform that passive to active allocation and the types of strategies you're using. I think Chris said it very very well. You think about not only that balance, but do you have things that are that are more on the downside protection, less aggressive? You maybe use a more of a defensive strategy, whether that be active or passive. You think about the fixed income exposure. Do you go from an intermediate exposure to short to ultrash short over the duration of that portfolio of what you're trying to achieve? All of that will balance those returns and help you achieve that objective. And throughout that, you're likely balancing active and passive in very different ways. Backtoback beautiful answers to a loaded question. That's I got I got the top level guys here today. Chris, let me go back to you. You know, with the rise of thematic and factor-based ETFs, do you think we're seeing a blurring of the lines between active and passive? How do you define those boundaries today? Yeah, so active ETFs are, you know, entering a tough arena, right? the ETF market is dominating. It's been synonymous with passive, right, for the past 30 plus years and and to some extent it still is. But as we know, right, active ETFs are gaining a lot of share. Um, month over month, quarter over quarter, their flows are representing 20, 30, 40% of the overall industry flows, whereas they only represent 8% of the overall ETF market. And so for a lot of ways, you know, passive factor-based rules-based ETFs uh are still the the the strategy of choice given the size of that of that pool of assets in those in those strategies. Uh but active ETFs are are starting to kind of wedge themselves in to the factor-based rules-based strategies in the ETF rapper that exist. There's a quote I I really like from Harry Day who was a Royal Air Force pilot during World War II that says, \"Rules are for the obedience of fools, for the guidance of wise men.\" And I think that's a really interesting quote when putting that into perspective of investing and and particularly passive versus active, right? A lot of these indices that we talk about that uh track these ETFs are rules-based, right? Maybe they're trying to isolate quality stocks or minimum volatility stocks in the US equity markets and have a specific set of rules that guide the index construction. Uh we all know rules work and rules can isolate those exposures but not necessarily be the best way of accessing that specific category or investment objective. And so active management is where we can take some ideas around what those rules give you uh but also provides some additional levers in and thoughtfulness to approaching that investment style. And so you can still get access, for example, to highquality dividend growth stocks with an actively managed strategy but not be indentured to the rules of a passive dividend growth, for example, ETF, right? And we think that that that freedom of being able to go outside the rules and to understand kind of why a specific company is increasing its dividend at a specific rate or why it cut their dividend and what that means to the future dividend payments to that company and whether or not we think this is a good buying opportunity is really important rather than being again indentured to the rules where we might have to remove that stock or not be able to own that stock in an active in a passive rules-based dividend portfolio, whereas otherwise we could own that in an active dividend growth portfolio. So, I think it's it's blurring the lines, but it's also allowing investors to still get access to a specific investment objective or strategy like dividend growers or quality, but we think in a more thoughtful way through the access of active management. I love that you're bringing World War II quote, so I'll give you a Churchill one. The price of greatness is responsibility. There you go, David. How do you see things? You know, from our vantage point at TRA Asset Management, I don't think the lines are blurring. I think they've been blurred for many years. Um I I go back and and look back. It's been now I think a decade plus uh just as an example that that Morning Star first introduced what they called the strategic beta classification system where they they really sought to deliver a framework that allowed investors to assess traditional cap weighted index strategies relative to more factor-based index strategies. I think maybe just there's a question about blurring because there's been more proliferation of those types of strategies whether they're thematic, they're factor-based rules-based index strategies or factor-based active strategies. The proliferation is just likely increased the uh the evidence in the marketplace that those lines have been blurred for quite some time. I think the key component to think about here is less about whether the lines are blurred. It's more about how you bring those strategies together to help you achieve your investment outcomes. You know, Chris mentioned factor exposures earlier and making sure they're they're balanced. I think, you know, it's important for um folks viewing viewing this session to to really kind of think about what exposures do traditional cap weighted indexes provide? Many times and over the course of time, cap weighted index strategies tend to provide greater exposure to factors like growth and momentum. That's not good or bad. It's just the reality of the way they are constructed and awaiting based on market cap. As the market cap gets bigger, the waiting increases. That tends to be a factor relating to growth and momentum. And that can result in wide swings of performance over time if growth and momentum factors go out of favor. So we've been talking to investors for a long time about thinking through those factor exposures. It's one of the reasons that that over a decade ago we launched the Schwab fundamental index products. Those strategies are based upon research affiliates fundamental indexes. the methodology of those indexes tend to provide more exposure to smaller names and valueoriented exposures. So supporting a notion that Chris had earlier about bringing together different factors in the case of market cap with growth and momentum alongside value factors that can provide it has the opportunity to provide rather a smoother ride over time for investors and over a full market cycle the ability to deliver improved performance. The same can be said as you bring in active managers into that strategy. understand the exposures you're getting and how they balance out the exposures you may get in your passive strategies um really can help guide the balance that you uh bring together in your overall portfolio. That's it's perfectly said and David, let me stay with you and and let's talk about the role tactical allocation decisions play in a mixed strategy portfolio and who should be making those calls. Is it advisers, portfolio managers, or these days algorithms? Yeah. Well, I I think first off, we start with the notion that time in the market tends to be more important than timing the market. Uh I think that you've heard and many investors have heard that time and time again. Um and I think it rings true. But there is an important component of thinking about your allocation decisions. And many times I think about starting with not tactical allocations per se, but thinking more around making sure you're rebalancing your portfolio back to your strategic weights. That is in effect a way to think about tactical allocations. Why does that become so important? You think about a traditional portfolio and I'll keep it really really simple and say a 60% equity portfolio 40% fixed income. If over time as has been has as has historically been the case if equity markets outperform fixed income that original 6040 portfolio is going to appreciate in value faster than the fixed income. And you may get to a point in the future where that balance is now 70% equity, 30% fixed income. By the very nature of reducing your equity exposure back to 60% and reallocating the your 40% to fixed income, it's a natural way to reallocate because what are you doing? You're selling your winners and you're buying your losers, so to speak, right? That's what you want to do when you when you tactically allocate. You want to overweight to your winners and underweight to your losers. By naturally doing that over time, it's a way to think about a tactical allocation, but just bringing it back to those strategic weights. Beyond doing that type of rebalancing, I think it gets back to a notion we talked about earlier and thinking about what is the propensity in this market environment for different strategies to outperform. you know, here recently, we've seen international markets outperform and and if you've had a view into that in advance, you know, a slight overweight to international would have certainly benefited your portfolio. But making sure you're doing that within a a range you kind of pre-established and you're basing that upon metrics you you understand in the marketplace and have a a high degree of certainty that it will drive that out performance over time. That's fantastic. explain Chris, we go over to you. And how do you see it? ETFs really lend themselves nicely to tactical asset allocation, right? And it's kind of one of the primary use cases early days of of active or excuse me of ETFs is is tactical asset allocation through sectors and industries uh and even broader asset classes. And so I think that ETF as a tool is is really nicely designed for for tactical asset allocation. what drives that tact asset allocation I think is up for debate in in in terms of what strategy works best right there's certain technical indicators that that many look at in terms of driving their tactical asset allocation uh there are economic factors that that drive tactical asset allocation across sectors and factors uh in terms of when they work in certain economic environments um and then there's certainly just just purely kind of algorithmic driven momentum driven strategies that that can drive tactical asset alloc. I don't think there's one perfect silver bullet to as an input for what you should be basing your tactical asset allocation on. But I I do think ETFs are a great tool to implement tactical asset allocation. I do think tactical asset allocation uh could serve a really meaningful purpose in a portfolio almost as a sle, right? Like we talked about earlier as David just mentioned diversification strategies, right? How can a strategic asset allocation 60/40 portfolio be enhanced or complemented with a maybe tactical sector asset allocation strategy or international tactical asset allocation strategy as a bolt-on to that strategic uh diversified portfolio. uh I think it's certainly it deserves a purpose and uh you know an opportunity to to be a part of any client's portfolio but there's a lot more work that needs to be involved right you need to be able to build out a framework for how that tactical asset allocation is built upon and then implemented appropriately with the right tools I think now that you start to see more actively managed ETFs in the sector in industry categories where that's typically a place where tax asset allocation is traffic heavily in um you know maybe there's there's better alternatives than just owning the um pure gicks weighted sector ETFs that you've been using. Maybe an active manager in a tactical asset allocation portfolio can file some additional alpha on top of just a pure market cap weighted sector strategy for example. Um, and so I think there's just many ways to do it, but it goes back to diversification of strategies, right? Active equity, tactical asset allocation, passive equity, passive fixed income, active fixed income. You know, diversifying out your your tools and strategies and disciplines of those strategies in a portfolio we think over time will serve clients really well. And tax cost allocation is certainly a piece of that puzzle that that you could add. I definitely could have asked for two better guests. The way you guys have laid things out here today, it's been phenomenal so far. And Chris, let me start with you here. Uh, as ETFs continue to evolve, do you foresee active strategies gaining more ground within the ETF structure? Why or why not? Well, if if you go back to data and just look at the numbers, it's it's certainly indicating that way, right? If you look at one, the number of products being brought to market that are actively managed, the as I mentioned, the percentage of flows that are going into actively managed ETFs relative to their market share, it it's all pointing up and to the right in terms of the growth trajectory of the active ETF market. The number of issuers, right, have grown significantly. Traditional actively managed mutual fund issuers like TA Price have entered the ETF market and others. And so I think that active ETFs are are certainly here to stay uh and will continue to to capture market share across both the ETF market and the broader 40act fund mutual fund market as as investors look to find lower cost more tax efficient ways to still maintain active management in different pockets of their of their clients portfolio. So I think it's here to stay. I think what's really uh interesting to see is the diversification of of the active ETF market in terms of categories that uh are leading to flows in AUM. Um so when you look at the top five categories within the active ETF market, it's ultra ultra short-term fixed income, large cap poor, derivative income, hedged equity. So, a very wide variety of of strategies and asset classes that are finding money coming their way in the active ETF market, which I think is a really healthy sign. Um, you think about the growth of of a particular category. Uh, it's not just in a a couple of of traditional sectors like large cap growth or large cap. It's it's in a variety of strategies, which I think is only good for the investor, right? there's more options, more choices, more ways to build portfolios more effectively for your clients and um and build better outcomes. Absolutely. David, uh how do you see it? Much the same. I think there's a long runway for growth uh for active strategies in the ETF rapper. And I would point to a couple things behind that. You know, annually now for over a decade, Schwab has been conducting the ETF investor study. And and over that period of time, it's allowed us to really better understand preferences of investors. And the one thing that has held true over time is that investors increasingly prefer the ETF rapper as a way to gain investment exposure over mutual funds. And we've seen that with a huge migration of of assets moving from mutual funds to ETFs over the past decade plus. The other dynamic that you see within that study is that younger investors, those that are just really starting to build wealth, have a higher preference for ETFs over mutual funds than older investors. So I think that continues to support that as that younger generation continues to build wealth, their selection of choice in terms of product rapper will be an ETF over a mutual fund that will continue to drive asset growth within active strategies. Do we believe that active ETFs are going to overtake passive ETFs in AUM? I think the likelihood of that is quite quite small, but I would expect that active ETFs will continue to grow. reinforcing a point that Chris made about some of the the top asset capturing active categories in ETFs. You know, large core was was like is was one of the few in that list that is also one of the largest active mutual fund categories. So, I think there are a lot of assets that still set in active mutual funds that'll eventually migrate over to active ETF strategies and continue to drive growth in those products over time. So we continue to see that that growth of the active ETF space and and ETFs in general. Yeah, it really has been an incredible sea change. That is for sure. Like I say, it's great time to be alive. Let's go back to Chris. Technological or data advancements are helping to improve the synergy between active and passive strategies. Yeah. So one of the beautiful pieces in hallmarks of an ETF is is the predictability. All right. And I think that's mainly driven the fact that ETFs have primarily been rules-based or passive and given advisors, investors access to predictable outcomes, meaning indices that are built upon whether it's financial metrics like quality or value um or simply just market cap weighted. and and you can regress those those factors back in time to understand kind of how those would act um and how they would perform in different market environments. And what I think techn technological advancements are are helping active managers with are harnessing some of those predictable factors and kind of benefits that predictability provides to investors but also overlaying fundamental active management which we think again is is critical in terms of long-term success for for investors portfolio. So being able to provide those quantitative metrics, overlay fundamental analysis and really distill that portfolio into a basket of stocks within a particular category that screen well on both the qual the quantitative side for quality or value or growth as well as input our fundamental research into those specific names to identify really what we think would be the best basket of that type of exposure. uh is really where I think technology is helping active managers kind of blur the lines between predictability and and pure quant with fundamentals. So quantal is what we maybe might call it in terms of being able to given investors that predictable outcome but with the benefits of of long-term fundamental active management on top of it uh in the ETF wrapper which is very suitable for that type of investment approach uh is a is I think a really big opportunity for the ETF market and for a firm tier price. We continue to look at that as as ways to bring product and marketing strategies to market to offer investors. Amazing stuff. Well listen that's all the time we have. I want to thank David and Chris for all their fantastic and great insights. This conversation really does underscore the fact that ETF investors have an incredible breath of choices before them today. Having a clear understanding of passive and active ETFs and the unique benefits they both bring to the table is table stakes for building a very smart portfolio.
