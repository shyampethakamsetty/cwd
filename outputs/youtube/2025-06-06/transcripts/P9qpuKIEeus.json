  "title": "6 Tips for Managing Multiple Accounts in thinkorswim®",
  "transcript": "Hey, my name is Kiara. I work here \nat the trade desk at Schwab. If you   are someone that's looking to manage multiple \naccounts for yourself or even for your family,   I'm going to show you some tips on how to be \neffective and faster on the thinkorswim® platform. First things first. Let's say you want to have all \nof your accounts showing on one page. To do that,   you would just click on the Accounts tab up \nat the top. And you're going to select TOTAL   ALL ACCOUNTS. Now currently I am under \nthe Monitor, Activity and Positions tab. So, I get to see all of my stocks in one go. The   problem here is that I don't know \nwhich stock is in which account. If you want to see which stock \nbelongs to which account,   to do that, go to the menu bar on \nthe same row of position statement. You're going to select Group symbols by and \nthen choose Account. Now what we have here is   that all of our stocks are broken up according \nto the account that they're held in. Right now,   I have all of my stocks under my margin \naccount and the others under my IRA account. All right, so you've done your research, \nand you've made a watchlist for yourself. Now you're ready to paste this on \nthe charts tab and get to trading.   The problem is, is that you have a lot \nof symbols that you're working with,   and it's going to take forever for you \nto type each of them in and each cell.   I'm going to show you a faster way to \npaste them all with just a few clicks. So, we're going to go to the Charts tab first. \nAnd next we're going to build our layout. So,   I'm going to go to the grid section. And for \nour example I'm going to do a two by two. Next,   I'm going to click the menu bar and I'm going to \nselect Load symbols to cells. We're going to visit   Personal. And then for my example I have mine \nsaved as My Watchlist. And there you have it. So now you're ready to place a trade. And you're \nlooking at a symbol. And you want to make sure   that this is across multiple accounts. \nIn our example, I'm going to use Disney. So, I'm going to right click over \nthe quote. And in this example,   I'm going to select BUY. Now my default quantity \nis set to 100. If you want yours a little bit   more or a little less and you want to save \nit for future trading, we can go to the gear   wheel here up at the top right corner, and \nwe're going to select Application Settings. We're going to visit the Order defaults tab. \nAnd then just for stocks in this example you're   going to go to the default quantity of orders. \nHere you can change it to increments of 50, 10,   or whatever quantity you've determined. Once \nyou're happy with those changes go ahead and   click Apply settings. Now back to the trade for \nDisney, I'm okay with buying them at market. So, I'm going to change my order type from \nlimit to market. Okay, we are almost there.   So, we're going to click Confirm and Send. Now \nbefore we send this order off, keep in mind   that the default setting is going to be single \naccount. Now to trade across multiple accounts,   what you're going to do is change this \nSingle Account tab to Multiple Accounts. You will see all of the accounts \nlisted under your profile.   Right now, mine is set to a ratio of 75 \nshares in my margin account and 25 shares   in my IRA. If you want yours to be 50/50 or \nany other variations, you can simply click   under the Quantity and then just change the \nquantity here to anything that you determined. Once you're happy with those settings, if you \nwant to save that layout for future trading,   go to Save current distribution. Give it a name. \nClick Save and you can always have it here,   saved going forward under Apply saved \ndistributions. Now if you want to make   sure that your order entry always defaults to \nmultiple accounts, check this little box here. This is Save last used mode. This \nwill save you some time in the   future. I'm happy with where it's set \nup right now, so I'm going to hit Send. Awesome, okay, so just to track our progress \nwe're going to go to the Monitor tab. And we're   going to take a look at our filled orders. \nGiven with Disney I bought them at market,   they filled right away. And I \ncan see here when I look below   position statements. My new shares \nof Disney under both of my accounts. And these are just a few ways that \nyou can trade more efficiently on   thinkorswim when it comes to \nmanaging multiple accounts.   For more thinkorswim videos visit \nschwab.com/learn.
