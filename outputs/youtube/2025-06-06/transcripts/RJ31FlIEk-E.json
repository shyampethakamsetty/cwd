  "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] [Music] Hi, this is Ben, senior trading mentor here with ITPM. Uh, I hope you're all doing well, making money in the markets. Okay. So, the on andoff tariff development that's been causing the market volatility um has kind of subsided and the market as far as the S&P 500 is now higher than where it was before this whole mess started in the first place. We are actually within uh around 5% of all-time highs in S&P. So for the most part um the the broader areas of the market has just shrugged this off and the focus is now back to earnings and what the future will look like. Speaking of that, Nvidia reported last week um delivered pretty solid numbers overall. Um so quarter to date of the S&P 500 473 companies uh reported. Okay. and 368 of them exceeded EPS consensus and 87 uh trailed the consensus and 18 reported inline results or thereabouts. So uh the macro data that's also been coming out has been mixed. Um now we did have a weak ISM manufacturing printers this morning came in at 48.5 which is actually one point below the consensus but the market reaction so far at least has been muted and all eyes are on the Fed meeting coming out later this month but um but so far the probability for a rate cut in June is actually very low. So now the rebound that we saw in April and May was actually fairly broad base. It didn't really start out that way, but then it expanded. Um, it was led by tech, okay? Although there were several other sectors that did quite well as well. Uh, but tech will be the focus on this idea. And the stock I'm looking at is uh as a long idea is Unity Software. Ticker is U. Uh, last traded at at $26. Okay. is a $10 billion market cap company and they operate a platform that allow users to uh create games uh and other content that they can grow and then monetize. is pretty neat actually and they are the market leader in this space in this uh kind of real-time 3D development uh and is really the building block behind more than 50% of mobile games actually which was uh bit surprising when I saw that but yeah and they're also expanding outside of gaming into uh 3D tech for industries like automotive architecture film you know obviously simulation and healthcare so this This is what the chart looks like over the past few years. Um, and my EPS is still negative. It is improving in the tune of uh close to 50% for this fiscal year versus last year. Um, and the free cash flow here is kind of a big thing where they have really broken that out and it's doing dramatically better. That plus the margins are expanding as well. Now, as far as valuations for companies that have negative earnings like this, uh we can look at some other metrics. Price to sales or enterprise value to sales. Enterprise value is just a market cap plus the total debt minus cash basically. Anyway, in both cases, um price to sales and enterprise value to sales are around six times, which is yes, it's fairly high, but it's not crazy high. um especially for companies like this kind of techy companies that are pre- earnings with just massive growth potential. All right, so they um they reported on May 7th and they beat revenue estimates by 30 million. When I was looking into this earnings call, I found um several catalysts, but there was one that kind of stuck out was their um their AI platform which they have been talking about upgrading to um well their ad based platform actually which they were upgrading to an AI based platform that the name Vector happened way ahead of schedule. Okay. So this has already resulted in 15 to 20% rise in iOS uh users. Um and that said that is likely I mean we're seeing it already there have been multiple broker upgrades but management did acknowledge that um we're going to see some uh could see some potential short-term revenue impacts from the mitigation of the legacy legacy products. Okay. So plus that as far as seeing this showing up in the bottom line or the or the earnings per share might takes a while to show up. So last week Jeff upgraded the company on the back of all this and we also seen EPS revisions ticking higher as you can see here. Okay. So how would I structure this for a limited risk high ROI options trade? they're scheduled to release earnings the first week of August. Um, and I want to have exposure to that. Okay, so in this case, it would be a classic calendar ratio spread. That's what makes the most sense here. And as with all my trades, the options chain is liquid, okay, with reasonable bid ass spreads for efficient execution. If you try to trade options where you don't where you have massive bid spreads, um, you're just making it more difficult for yourself. Anyway, going long 20 of the August 28 strike calls at 320 will cost you $6,400 and then simultaneously adding a short leg where you sell 10 since it's a ratio. So, you sell half of the July 30 strike calls at 180 gives a credit of $1,800. That's how we set this up. Right now, the total calls for that would be $4,600. Uh, and we're looking at this within the context of $100,000 portfolio. Basically, this is now set up with limited risk and um unlimited profit potential, which is uh what we like to see. And if the stock stays below the short strike of 30, which is the recent resistance uh until the July um expiration, then we'll capture the full credit of $1,800. And then that uh if you look a little bit further out in time uh especially towards earnings the high end of the range from last year and also uh 2023 was uh bit a bit over 40 a couple of points over 40. Okay. So I think it's feasible for the stock to get back up there later this year uh especially uh over the next earnings release. So in that case, let's say the stock gets through 40, okay, in August, the long leg will have a profit of $17,600. Okay? So that would be 40 minus the 28 strike minus the 320 cost times the 20, which is the size. Um, and if you then add that to the $1,800 profit on the shortling, we have a total P&L of 19,400 in this case. And that's a 4 to1 real world risk. So that's pretty nice. All you need is like you get one of these right, it more than makes up for several losing trades. Um anyway, there are many ways that this can play out. Obviously stock could go a lot harder higher than 40 or might not even move at all. Uh but let's just let's presume it rips before August. Like so by July it gets to 40. Well then what? Well, now you have a loss on the short leg because it's in the money. But since we net long 10 calls, plus the August uh calls are further in the money and they have time value left since they expire in August, the total P&L for that trade in that case, if the stock just rips right away to 40 will be uh over $11,000. Um it will be a loss. Okay, if the stock stays below 28 till August and we just take no action to remedy that, but the max loss is the cost of 4,600. All right, then. So, I like this one a lot. That's all I got for today. Catch you next time. [Music]"
