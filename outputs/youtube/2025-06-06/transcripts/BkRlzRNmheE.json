  "transcript": "Daily stock trading podcast in my ears guiding me through my hopes and fears. Tune in daily. Don't miss a single show. Sign up for the newsletter. Let us help you grow. Taking race, making moves, seeking success. Together we'll conquer. No room for any last. Good morning. It is Thursday, June 5th. There is a big show today. Okay, I've got a lot. We're going to go over Alpha Pick performance. We are going to go over the top 2025 stocks performance. We will go over the MAG 7. We will go over alternative ETFs with the income. We will go over um the jobs number just came out. Was it 255,000 like we predicted? No, just FYI, but there are is jobs noobs. We will look at Finn Viz. I took a look at the S&P 500. I'll give you some stats to show you that we're in a bull market. Uh Circle IPO today. We've talked about it. I'll look at it. Uh, don't give up on Uber. We'll talk about Tesla, Spotify, um, an ETF that hit an all-time high yesterday. Uh, and if you're looking for an AI ETF, uh, Dan Ives just released one. We will rank the 30 names in there. Earnings, MongoDB killed it. Uh, tonight we have AVGO. I'll give you a YOLO trade yesterday that was up something like 186%. Uh, and we'll look at Coreeave and everything around Coreeave. uh stock that I like better than coreweave that's in the same thing. Uh we'll give you a fire tip uh on HSA savings and then I will show you why in this market when you see a piece of data there is no reason to say I don't know what that means. It is a perplexity uh question that I basically saw a tweet about bonds that points us in the direction that we are going up further and I didn't know what it meant. So I took perplexity and did that. That's at the end. But let's first go over Alpha Pix. Okay, you can't see this performance but I will read it to you. Since inception, Alpha Pix is up 166% versus the S&P 57%. Okay. Then you go three months, this is all on my Twitter. 3 months, the S&P is up 2%. Alpha Pix is up 11%. Then you go one year, the S&P is up 12%, Alpha Pix is up 16%. And year to date, the S&P is up 1.69%. Alpha Pix 2.92%. Almost doubling on almost every metric. It's almost doubling. Alpha Pix is beating. Okay. So, if you have TR, if you have Seeking Alpha at the beginning of the year, then you've got Alpha Pick, you know, if you have the bundle. And then let's add in uh Seeking Alpha because Steve Crest released his top 10 quant stocks of 2025 up nearly 25% year to date. So it's outperforming the market. Remember the S&P is only up 1%. These 10 stocks are up nearly 25%. He has had a track record three years. the 10 stocks from the beginning of the year, they have outperformed the S&P by a large margin. We're talking hundreds of percent return. So, if you have the Seeking Alpha bundle, okay, the bundle is the premium service where you get the top 10 stocks and Alpha Pix, which is a portfolio that has beaten the S&P. Okay? And you save $159. go over to Linkree and click that second link because Steve just wrote an update to the top 10 stocks. And so he's updating it. Hey, we're through the first five months. What can you expect from these 10 stocks in the later half of the year? And then there's going to be a bonus. Okay, June 17th, he is having a threehour program webinar where he's going to go over the stocks and then he's going to tell you, hey, here's 10 stocks that might perform in the second half of the year. He's got an amazing track record. So, if you want seeking Alpha Premium, again, this is June 17th. So, if you just want seeking Alpha Premium, okay, you don't want the Alpha Pix portion, I would wait until June 17th and then I'd go over to my link tree and I would click on this third link. The third link is just seeking Alpha, okay? It's Seeking Alpha Premium. You get 7 days for free. I would wait, but I would attend that June 17th uh webinar because not only do you get a free 7-day trial, you get $30 off when you sign up. Everything's on my link tree. Again, the bundle is the second link. Seeking Alpha Premium is the third link and Alpha Pix is the fourth link. Alpha Pix again, it's one stock, one stock on the 1, one stock on the 15th. They tell you when to sell. It is a phenomenal phenomenal uh portfolio. It has shown me that a rules-based portfolio, it's made me a better investor. I will tell you, a better investor managing my own portfolio. And I've been doing this for years. But that's what it is. I do suggest the bundle. Doesn't come with a free trial, but I suggest the bundle because most people who have had the bundle with Alpha Pix and the top 10 stocks, they've already paid back their subscription just with those two portions. Add in some YOLO stuff that they got from Seeking Alpha Quants and managing their own portfolio by being able to import it and some of the webinars that they have. you're probably doing much better than me because my portfolio is stuck because of Apple. Want to know why? Well, let's look at MAGS. The Mag 7. That's the Mag 7. Now, I do own I'm sorry, MAGS is what I want. But I do own all of the Mag 7. I do own all of them. Not in the same like not in an even way. Uh, Apple is like 40% of my portfolio. But you can see right here if I go to charting and I show you year-to- date, we're underperforming the MAG 7, the S&P, the S&P is up 1.52, Mag 7 is up 2, down 2.7, but one year you're beating. So, it's your time frame. Okay. Do I think that this will continue? Yes, I do. So, uh, one of the things that I've suggested in the short term is leverage ETFs. And this person that that Fred paired, he goes over SOXL, it's lagging behind the unleveraged index for 10 years. This article explains why and how leverage ETFs drifts and calculates the current and 10-year average drift of SOXL. He goes over it in detail. So, if you're interested in leverage ETFs, this is a trading strategy again, seeking alpha. It gives you information and something different. I don't do this, but Shauna here, she's an expert in alternative ETFs. She's the founder and CEO of Ben Ryan Capital Management, and she goes over it in detail. Now, if you don't know what alternative ETFs are, these are like your Jet Q or your basically it trades options for you and at the end of the month it pays out enormous dividends and there are some that are tax advantaged. There are some that are not, but you can g get like 20% dividend in a in a stock that's trading high volatility. And she goes over how to do it. And many times you can double your performance of just buying and holding the stock by using these alternative ETFs. Okay, it's a great again Seeking Alpha, what a phenomenal tool. It gives you all of this. So if you're interested in doing your own research, no popups involved, you know, again, no ads. It saves you time. I talked about earlier in the week how the initial jobless claim on the compound uh they they had predicted that 255,000 uh jobs loss was going to send the market into a tizzy. Today's the job numbers it wasn't 255 it was 247 even though the the jobs come in at higher higher than expected. Let's see how QQQ reacted to that jobs number. Nothing. I mean, absolutely nothing. This is a 5minute chart right there. Do you see a movement? I don't. I just see it kind of continuing. It doesn't care. It doesn't care. But jobs are the issue. And what are we seeing? Proctor and Gamble today announced 7,000 non-match non-manufacturing jobs over the next two years among tariff uncertainty. They point out this is to offset the effects of tariffs and explore cost reductions in product reformations and selective price increases. So again they are pointing it out that jobs will be lost because we have to pay more for tariffs. It represents 15% of the company's non-manufacturing workforce. This could be robotics as well. They could be just using this as an excuse. Okay? This could be AI. This could be a bunch of different things. They're choosing tariffs. Expect some nasty, nasty rhetoric from the White House on this. Okay? And I went to Finn Viz today and I said, you know what? I'm going to use this screener and I'm going to use the screener to look at the S&P. Okay, the S&P. Let's look at how many hit a new high 50-day uh high. Uh I'm sorry, 52. Let's Let's look at this. Let's look at the 52- week low. Okay. No companies hit a 52- week low. None. Let's look at how many hit a new high. 20. 20 hit a new high, none low. That's of the S&P 500. Okay, let's look at how many stocks are trading under their 200 day. Okay, price below their 200 day. 257. That means there's opportunity in stocks that are under their 200 day but haven't hit an all-time high. Okay, that's a big amount. That's half the S&P 500. Let's look at how many are trading under their 50-day. And this is all, you know, you can do this for free. 155 are below their 50-day. That's again, that is a large amount of stocks that have hit a key support level that are below that. So, there's opportunity in this market. That's my point of this. and Trendpider. You want a reason to try out Trendpider? Try this. They spotted a candle pattern we thought could offer real edge. So, we built a custom indicator out of it. No manual coding required at all. The logic behind the swing detector, it highlights a three candle pattern that signals a bullish. This is called the three bar. Okay. Candle one, C, I'm sorry, candle two sweeps candle one's lows, closes above it. Candle two closes above candle 2's high. Candle three, I'm sorry, bearish. Candle two sweeps. Candle one's low. Again, this is a swing indicator. So, you can scan for it. Here's the scanning. You can import this into your system completely. Okay? It beats buy and hold over the last 10,000 candles on a fraction of the draw down. That's just on futures. So, again, you want Trendpider. There are so many tools that I don't use in Trendpider that I don't show you, but if you go over to Linkree and the top link, Trendpider right here, again, it's a tool to help you and import that. I still need to import this and play with it, but it's the three bar system. It's what I've been waiting for. I asked them to do this. They just released it and they sent me an email and said, \"Hey, we built it for you. It's fantastic.\" You know what else is fantastic? IPOs. Because we talk about coreweave and we will talk about coreweave but circle they priced their IPO I think it's between 31 and $34. The symbol is CRC. Okay. This is the stable coin. It is uh is it overpriced? Abso freakingutely. This is an IPO that has been waited for. It is overpriced. It's overbought already. Okay. That's it. It is incredibly expensive. Is it tradable? Absolutely. So, if you are sitting around this afternoon and have nothing to do, go on CRCL and just try and trade it based on the candles. Get a little You can do it with paper trading. But again, try it out. This will offer some incredible, incredible volatility. And you can use a chart. You don't have to use Trendpider. Use a chart. use anything, Active Trader Pro, Think or Swim, Weeble, whatever you want. But the Circle IPO, it is completely going to be a crazy crazy time. Again, the the these shares were marketed between 27 and $28. That's 10% over what they marketed these shares for. Now, let's talk about Tesla. Um because I've been bringing up the Tesla, hey, they got this robo taxi thing happening in in San Antonio. Uh you know, I think it's San Antonio. I forget where. Don't take it for, you know, hey, this is going to be a great thing. Remember there are two companies that tried robo taxis automated uh driving Uber and GM who had public incidents of people dying with the robo taxis which completely shut down the business. So there is it's in Austin not in San Antonio. It is incredibly risky for Tesla to do this. If you don't think that that Elon fighting with Trump right now over the bill and then saying, \"Well, you know what? We're going to do this and then somebody dies.\" And then Trump has his ability to go out there and say, \"Well, maybe he shouldn't have done it so soon. Maybe he doesn't know what he's talking about. He told me that the bill was bad. Maybe there's something that's happening there.\" Okay, Tesla just got you out of the 4hour algorithm. got you out with a nice 29% gain. Is it losing its traction? Well, the April low trend line has been broken. These are what's called raindrop candles. Okay, raindrop candles in in in Trendpider, they show you the the left is the first half of the day, the right is the second half of the day, and it shows you the closing price with that little line that you see right there. It shows you the direction with red or green, but it shows you volume as well. Where's the volume on the candle? It's at the low end. Where's the close? It's below its open. It gives you tons and tons of information. Again, Tesla, maybe it's going into weakness. We've got the 4hour algorithm right here telling us get out. the 4hour algorithm, 24 positions, it makes you 68% versus 80% if you buy and hold. It's pretty good. You know, again, if you're trying to trade a riskon asset like Tesla and you've broken this trend line, maybe it's time to take some profits. Just saying. Just saying. Now, don't throw Uber out. Just because Tesla's doing this, don't throw them out. They tapped Nikesh Aurora for its board. Nikesh is a former top Google exec during Whimo's early years, bringing insider knowledge just as Uber navigates its robo taxi partnership and rising pressure from Tesla. So again, Uber, it's a great stock at 84. It seems to be holding up there around 82. I like Uber. I own Uber. I think it's a $100 stock. If it gets down here towards the $70 mark, I will buy more. Do I like it? It's up 1.22% today. It is a fantastic, fantastic company. Now, what is it in Seeking Alpha? Let's go and look at Uber. Uber is a strong buy in the quant. Why? The valuation doesn't seem stretched. The growth is fantastic. The profitability is unbelievable. the momentum. It is up 29% or 30% over one year. Revisions, everybody's revising up. See what the 4hour algorithm tells us. It got us out with an 18% gain. Do you want to buy? Wait until the 4hour algorithm gets you in. Why? Because it makes you 80%. Yes, buying and holding makes you 121%. But you're buying at a fairly high price. When you take a look at this slider, the 52- week high is 93. Where does Wall Street think that it's worth? They think it's worth 95, which is still a 14% upside. So, don't forget about Uber. Don't just pile into Tesla saying, \"Oh my god, they got robo taxis.\" Uber is still around. It will still be a great stock. And if you want to know robotic stocks, because I think Tesla is more a robotic stock than a car company, here's a what are the robotic stocks to watch in 2025. Here they are. Amazon's one. Google's another, Nvidia, Intuitive Surgical. You can go and read this article about the robotic stocks that they suggest. It's a great list. Again, robotics and automation are going to be the future. Now, I own Spotify because my podcast, you're probably listening to me on Spotify because I get more listens on Spotify there. Not all of you are subscribed to the newsletter. I know it a large portion of you are not subscribed to the newsletter. I don't know why. You get all these charts, you get all these notes, you get all these links, you get everything in the newsletter for free. But I can't force you to subscribe. But I own Spotify because my podcast is hosted by them. Okay, they are the Netflix of audio. It's just a great business. Who was the clear leader off the bottom in April? Who is ripping into blue skies now that the rest of the market is catching up? Same answer. It's Spotify. I bought and held Spotify. I'm I think my average purchase price is somewhere in the hundreds. It's not. It is a great great stock. The 4-hour algorithm, it makes you about half of what buy and hold makes you, but you win 53% of the time. So, what would I see in this strategy? I would say, you know what, you win 53% of the time. I want to buy and hold over this time because it makes 370%. But I want to find an entry. So, that 581, it seemed uncomfortable. I bought more. That was April 10th. How far are you up since that fif uh 581 right there? Let's see. 28% in just 55 days. That's a great thing. And we are going for another run. The RSI is high. Let's look at the weekly. Have we reached a peak point? Well, your MACD is a little extended. Your RSI is completely extended. Would I be buying up here? Probably not. If we look at Spotify is expensive, go over to seeking alpha and let's look at it. It's a hold in the quant. Why the valuation? And if you want to analyze Spotify with AI and say, \"Ooh, maybe I want to buy this one.\" Well, spot the valuation seems stretched. Growth is impressive. Remarkable year-over-year eBay to growth of 465%. Profitability, they're mixed. Net income margin of 7% considerably beloved sectors. It's a B+, but your momentum, which is the number one thing I say, is an A. Exceptional one-year price performance of up 126%. Revisions, recent revisions are concerning with 27 uh downward in the last 3 months overshadowing the two upward. So again, you've got positives and negatives. This is an AI generated analyst report. I like Spotify. I hold it in my Weeble account. my Weeble account. By the way, if you want to join me on Weeble, that's on Linkree, too. Get some free stocks, get three or 20 free shares when you sign up. I put $1,000 in there. I'm up close to uh I think it's just over $12,000, but it's my YOLO account. I trade things like Spotify, and I bought and held Spotify for a very long time in that portfolio. Have a strategy. Okay, it's in my portfolio. Now, I want to look at an ETA. And the ETA, I'm sorry, the ETF is the aerospace and defense. Okay, this has reached an all-time high 181. When you look at the last month, you are up 11% in a freaking ETF, okay? It's an industrial ETF. It hit an all-time high. You're at 1819 is the all-time high. You're trading at 180. Do you want to buy this? Well, probably not. But let's look at the holdings. G Aerospace was 20%. RTX, Boeing, Axen. These are some opportunities with, you know, that you could buy. Axen has been flying, flying. This is an all-time high. 780 bucks. So, when you see an ETF like this, you should take notice. Do you want to trade it? I am not a defense guy. I don't own any of these companies. Boeing has been on a run. I've told you that Boeing over uh let's see 1 month you're up 13%. This was going to be used as negotiation. It's a great ETF. Again, it reached all-time highs. And if you're looking for an ETF that is AI focused, a new one is Dan Ives Web Bush. Okay, the actual symbol is IVES. It just started trading. So, you don't have charting for it. So, what do you do in in something like that? You look at the holdings. And here in Seeking Alpha, they have listed all 30 holdings that he has based on the quant level. Okay. And the the I'm sorry, the Seeking Alpha analyst grades. Taiwan Semi is the number one. Taiwan Semi is the number one Seeking Alpha rated stock. Okay. What do uh what does Wall Street think that it's worth? They think it's worth $224, which is a 10% upside. This one was up uh 2 and a half% yesterday. It was the leader yesterday. It was a great great stock to buy. Now, what's the high? 225. Again, you've got a 10% upside to this. So, Taiwan, don't think that, you know, just because Nvidia is out there in guess who makes Nvidia chips? It's Taiwan Semi. Now, the S&P tomorrow is going to announce new inclusions. Let's just flip a coin and see which ones go in. I will tell you apploving I love. Let's just go and look at the chart. Robin Hood, it's suggested that that one is is is probably going in, but I mean that one's at alltime highs. Applovin, you could have bought this yesterday below 400. Let's just go take a look at app loving. What's it? It's a strong buy in the quant. Your 52-W week high is 525. What does Wall Street think that it's worth? They think it's worth 457. That's a 10% upside. So, if they get included, expect it to go up by 10%. Robin Hood, on the other hand, am I buying into this one? Wall Street thinks it's worth $62. That's 14% downside. And when you look at the summary, $73 is the all-time high. Does it mean you sell this if you have it? No. It's got momentum. Do you trim it? I would be taking some profits. Absolutely. But if they get included in the S&P, expect everybody to start buying this one. And again, volume drives the price. So, take a look at these because this is what Bank of America thinks these are the most likely ones to go up. Now, what does Robin Hood say? What are traders doing? They're not in the MAG 7. They are not in the mag seven. They are in things like Salesforce, Octa, and Marvel. Okay, that's it. I mean, they're not buying the the the big seven. While these tech giants remain nearly flat in recent trading, Nvidia continues to be the stock top the top stock that retail traders are selling. They're not buying it. They're actually portfolio managers is what Steve Cirk who's Robin Hood's chief uh brokerage officer said. They're taking their portfolio and when they see significant gains in a name a short period of time, they're rotating out of some of that and moving to some other names among the beneficiaries again like Salesforce, Octa, and Marvel. Okay. Cryptocurrency remains another consistent interest for Robin Hood's cousin. The number one instrument that has been bought for almost five years is Bitcoin. IBIT. Buy it and hold it. That's it. I I mean again, the market's in a bull market. There are several stocks that I mentioned. One is MongoDB. MongoDB had earnings last night. They killed it. I wrote down that they're up 15% in pre-market. They're up 18%. But just to show you that the quant isn't always right. It's a strong sell. This is way down. Okay, you're trading at $235. Your 52- week high is $370. And the quant still says strong sell. Expect this to move up to probably a hold or a sell. But when you look at why it's per going to perform badly characteristics historically, the company has a one-year price performance of minus 52%. It's a stock that probably is rebound. Again, use Trendpider. Use Trendpider, you know, use the charts to try and find out, use that reversal that I just talked about. You know, the 4hour algorithm, it it makes you 3%. You may say, \"Oh my god, that's horrible.\" But buying and holding loses you 30% over the last two years. Now, has this one turned around? Look, it's below its 200 day. You know, as you get to to to to today's price at 230, 240, you're just getting to the 50-day. You're going to gap up on the weekly, but look at how low that MACD is. Look at how low the RSI is. Do you want to buy in? Maybe it's time to start looking at it cuz they blew it out of the water. And today's earnings, today's is Broadcom. This is a key to the market. Okay, Broadcom. We saw AMD kill it. We saw Nvidia kill it. We saw Credo kill it. We saw a lot of chip manufacturers kill it. But Broadcom, when you go and look at it, it's overbought. It's part the lead name in the momentum ETF. Okay, this has been crazy. I sold during this this time when it was down. I made a mistake. Am I beating myself up? No. I made a profit. Okay. I didn't get back in. But I've got exposure to this through ETFs like QQQ, like XLK. I've got a ton of exposure to it. Would I have liked to held on to it? Abso freakingutely. But the strategy that I had was I am going to wait for this to be long-term capital gains and then I'm going to sell it. And as it started to get down and I started to see my profits dwindle, I sold. There ain't no diamond hands here. So AVGO, if we look at it today right here, uh AVGO, oh stock index futures rise as China's GB and and Trump hold a call. I guess they talk to each other. So stock futures are up again. The market at the end I'm going to go over what what it is. But do I want to buy AVGO here at 265 when you're trading at 262? 265 is a 52-W week high. You're trading at 262. It would make sense if Wall Street didn't think it was worth 250 bucks. I mean, do I think that it's going to pop? I think it's going to be very much like Nvidia going into earnings. You're going to see people start to take profits. If they blow it out of the water and something happens, you're going to see people start to take profits. So, I I love the name. I want to get into it. I just don't like where it's trading right now. That's it. And let's talk about, you know, before we go into coreweave, let's talk about yesterday's uh yolo trade because a name that is quite often traded and I've traded in the past. It took off yesterday. These are ones where you want to learn how to trade a chart. Okay, this is this can be quite lucrative if you're setting a watch list and you set alerts. It's more about being organized and having the tools that allow you to do this. So, if I had this, you know, I had this in my watch list uh to trade and it just came up with an alert randomly that it was getting over its uh over its 9-day EMA on a fivem minute chart and it said, \"Hey, this one in your watch list kicked it.\" Well, where would I bought it? I would have bought it at $6 yesterday. $6 in the morning. Where did it get up to before it really lost confirmation? $24. I would have four times my money. Okay, over the period of yesterday. So, it's about being organized. It's about having these huge volatility names on your list and then setting up alerts. It's not that hard. Really, it isn't. You know what's hard? Buying and holding Cororeweave. Uh, it is down 3% in the pre-market, but it was up 8% yesterday and it it rose after results of its largest ever Nvidia Grace Blackwell GPU cluster. Again, I am not I'm a fan of this business, but I I am not a fan of this is a short squeeze. This is an absolute short squeeze. APLD, which is applied materials, also had a great move yesterday. Okay, it was up 29% yesterday. It's up 5% in pre-market. So, you go over 5 days, this is up 90%. This is 90%. It's 90%. But the the name that I like that that is data center it's not coreweave. I think this one is just a short squeeze. You can see short interest 30%. But the name that I like it's Nebus and this particular uh analyst goes over this Nebus and says hey I love the stock. Go and read this article. Okay. I like that one. Another one that I like that's kind of in the same area is NVTS. Okay, let's go and look. Over one month, this is up 239%. See that pop right there to $4. Where are you trading today? $6.78. Almost $7. That's almost doubling since that pop. That pop was when Nvidia said, \"Hey, we're investing in this se semiconductor uh company.\" That's it. That's it. I Is it overpriced? Abso freakingutely it's overpriced. The valuation is nuts. But they're not making money. So, do I want to get into this one? I don't think so. I mean, there's eight analysts that cover it. They think it's worth $3 and you're at $6. Now, Shy Bouular has a great go and just type into Twitter NVTS and Shy Bouular. He will show you why he's holding on to this. He loves it. go and read about again read the analysis of it and if you like it go and buy it. It's very simple. There are plenty of stocks in this market that do that. Now I want to do a fire tip Friday cuz I'm not sure I'm going to have a fire tip tomorrow and I found this one and I thought it was interesting. This is about your HSA. Okay, so HSA is your healthcare savings account and do your research about HSA if you're unfamiliar with it. It's tax ded tax deduction uh taxfree growth, taxfree withdrawal for medical purposes. It also exempts from FICA if contributed through employer payroll deductions. So you don't pay any taxes on this stuff, okay? Going in or coming out, but it's got to be medical expenses. Now, if you have the money and and I've done this hack, but if you have the money and you can afford to leave the money in there, just save the receipt. And that's what this tip is. Okay. The reason, say you put, you know, $100 into your HSA, and there's limits on this, and this isn't tax advice, but say you put $100 in there when you're 21 years old, and you have a $100 a dental bill that you want to pay. Don't pay it through your HSA. Pay it out of your taxable account, okay? Pay it on a credit card. do whatever you need to do because that $100, keep the receipt. That $100 can compound into thousands or tens of thousands of dollars by the time you retire. And by the time you retire, you will have significant medical expenses because you've saved your receipts. There is no statute of limitations on when the money needs to come out. It just needs to come out for medical purposes. That's it. That's it. And there is a long list of medical purposes that you can justify for that money coming out. I have an HSA. I put $3,000 into there. It's something like $30,000 now because I'm able to invest it. It's through Fidelity. If you're interested, don't do your employer HSA because those things are crap. This is just my opinion. I had an employer HSA. They charged me fees. They made me invest in ETFs that were just  I went into Fidelity. It's a self-directed HSA. It's great. It is fantastic. So, if you can afford it, leave the money in there. Now, I'm going to finish off with this. Okay. What the the JC Parrots, who I love. Every time treasury bonds are down down here, they come back in and buy them. I had no idea what this means, but you can see and and you can see those green arrows. Every time the Treasury bonds are down there, and this is TLT, they come in and buy. Uh, your boy didn't know what this meant. I had no freaking clue. I'm like, what the f is JC talking about? There is no reason that anybody should ever ask me a question. There is no reason that you should read something and go, \"Oh, I don't know what that means.\" Because you have AI. I went in and I took a screenshot of JC's tweet and I said, \"Can you explain this tweet? What happens when quote unquote they step in and buy? And who is they?\" Okay, they are bond buyers. Okay, institutional investors. US pension funds, foreign governments, investors, Federal Reserve, individual investors, they step in and buy them. Perceive safety. US treasuries are considered some of the safest safest investments when they're attractive yields when the prices drop and yields rise, making bonds more attractive relative to other investments. So the tweet is pointing out a historical buying opportunity in treasury bonds knowing that every time prices have reached this low level buyers have stepped in causing prices to rebound. They refers to a mix of institutional investors, foreign governments, Federal Reserve and individual investors who see value in treasuries at these levels. Again, that makes sense to me. And if it doesn't ask AI, I don't understand this. Explain it to me like I'm 10 years old and it will. But I don't care about treasuries. I want to know what it means for the stock market. So I followed up and I said, \"What does this mean for the stock market?\" What does it mean? The tweet and chart suggests that US Treasury bonds as tracked by TLT fall to certain low levels buyers consistently step in causing bond bond prices to rebound. The pattern is important for the stock market because the relationship between bonds and stocks is closely linked through interest rates, yields, and investor sentiment. Bond buying pushes years down. Lower yields can support stocks. Safe haven. Okay. Bottom line. When major investors step in to buy Treasury bonds at historically low prices, it often signals a turning point for bonds and can create a more favorable environment for stocks unless broader economic ris or c persistent inflation keeps yields elevated in which case both markets can remain under pressure. So, it's likely likely that we're seeing another leg up unless inflation comes back in or other factors come back in. I'm not saying that that the Fed's going to lower rates, but the EU just lowered rates. Trump is uh yelling lower rates and we've seen the taco trade. Trump always chickens out. Does the Fed now say, \"hm, we don't think he's going to put on the tariffs.\" and we see the the the the jobs market potentially being down. So, we're going to lower rates by a quarter point. I think that would take the market up. That would give the market some reassurance that the Fed isn't going to be too late. So, that's that's the whole podcast. That's it.
