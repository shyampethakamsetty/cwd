  "transcript": "Schwab. Welcome back to Market on Close. Here we're going to take a look at Tesla's chart here. Stocks down about 14% right now was just down 17%. The Thanksgiving Day battle between Trump and Elon Musk negatively affecting the shares here today just off the session. Lows here. Giving up some big gains that we've seen over the last couple of months. But yeah, this rift will probably continue. Some posts by Elon Musk on X have been causing more of the pain. Donald Trump pushed back on Truth Social. So we'll continue to watch this story, but negatively affecting the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100, all four of the major indices. Now we started the show. We had two of them positive now two, all four of them negative territory. All right. Let's bring in our next guest here on market on close. That's going to be Kevin Greene, senior markets contributor here on the network K.G. Give me your take here on some of the market action. Before we get into discussion about the option flows. Because this has been a spicy day to say the least. As far as the moves here in equities. Tom, everything was all good with the S&P 500 until you came back. And I think that's really the key factor. Now obviously we have this issue. What's going on with Tesla that's putting a little bit of pressure on the S&P 500. We also have to be mindful too. We've been trading in a little bit of a consolidated range over the last couple of trading sessions. We also have that jobs report tomorrow as well. So that's going to be a big headline mover. You might also see some derisking because of that. And I think that's also leading to some of the volatility that we're seeing on an intraday basis. But if you're looking at it going into the close here 5940 we kind of highlighted that earlier this morning. That was the key level of hole. We saw that break up going lower here. We started seeing a little bit of a catalyst of selling. And the next level was actually 5900. But we are able to recover. We did have this kind of triangle formation taking place here. You can call it an asymmetric triangle, if you will, that we did see obviously officially broke pretty much at that apex. We could go back up and retest that. That would be actually a pretty decent area for us to close here in order to try to recover some of these losses. That's sitting at around 59 US, 5950 here, Tom. So obviously aggressive selling, maybe we get some buying activity going into the close. Those short sellers covering those positions that market on close order will be a big deal today because of this Tesla sell off. But I think you just had compressions in the market. You had a reason to sell. Obviously you had a very big, you know, mega cap type of name that's getting impacted for the most part here. So you just had a lot of catalyst. You have this report going into tomorrow as well. So just a big catalyst. But we also hit off that 200 period moving average on the 15 minute chart as well as we have this up on the screen. So I think it's just a technical break that we have going into a major event tomorrow. Yeah. When you look at that 6000 level in the S&P 500, the SPX, that's become maybe an area of contention maybe for the Bulls and the bears at this point, because it seems like maybe it's become a little bit of a resistance today. This might be just a blip. And a lot of this is caused by Tesla today. But do you figure that that 6000 level on the S&P 500 is going to be the battleground here in the near term? It is going to be. And actually, Tom, it was the battleground when we were going and meeting, you know all time highs. We were only above that that 6000 level for probably maybe three weeks before we actually saw that breakdown to the downside here. So it's been a really key structural level for the last year or so. When you're looking at options positioning, I think it's a psychological level. I think there's also a structural level there as well. But once we are able to break through with some conviction on some large volume, that's where you can kind of get the squeeze to the upside. This kind of breakout pattern for the S&P 500. But it will be an area of resistance for now. And we have to just be mindful to we do have some major options expiration. We have the Quarterlies for June. That's going to be happening in about two weeks from tomorrow. And then we have the end of month options as well, which consist of that J.P. Morgan collar. So from an options standpoint, there's a lot of, you know, structure here that's going to expire. And you're going to have something called charm risk, which is time value risk. And you're going to have risk which is going to be volatility risk in the market leading up to those expirations. So yes, a key area of resistance. But I'm not really surprised that we continue to try to test it and then kind of backing back off from it. But at the end of the day we're getting closer and closer. We have some structural areas of support. The 20 day moving average, we did not test that today. The 200 day moving average is still a lot there for the bulls to really try to hold up this market. Yeah. When you look at the VIX it's back above the 18 level at this point. Some heightened volatility on this little pullback that we're seeing. Actually we we're almost back to where we are positive in the Russell 2000 now. But this is the kind of market that I think investors and traders should be prepared for at this point. Isn't it. Because it just seems like it's choppy here at these levels because there's still some uncertainty out there in the equity market. Yeah, definitely. So you have the seasonality effect happening when it comes to volatility. Usually once we hit the summer months we actually have lower volume pretty low liquidity. And that could create a pretty aggressive price action. But we can have these compressed type of markets for a week two weeks three weeks. You can actually look at that with the VIX seasonality chart I have a 15 year chart within that deck here. Now you do see a little bit of a blip when you're seeing this trend. And that's because of the summer fed meeting. We're going to have a fed meeting on June 18th. Also another special day. That's my birthday as well. But you're going to have a little bit of a spike there. But when you have these compressed markets I think it's just anything can really spark volatility moving higher. And so you have to be prepared for that as you as you stated here. But you also have to be prepared for rangebound markets, choppy markets. And if you're an intraday trader, sometimes that can be very tough, especially with this administration. That kind of can move headlines fairly quickly and can move markets fairly quickly. You can get chopped up fairly quickly here. So you got to be very risk defined. But also be mindful that we are getting into this period where we might not see as aggressive volatility as we have seen over the last two months or so. Let's see what tomorrow brings though. Tom, I think that's a big headline risk. If we do get a bad print for BLS, does the market actually start trading in the fashion of the fed? Could be accelerating rate cuts, and is that going to kind of give us even more of a boost to the upside? That has been something that we've seen in the past. October 2023 was one of those great examples where that was pretty much the low of the cycle. When we started moving higher in anticipation of rate cuts being fairly aggressive from the fed. Yeah. And that we talked about that on fast market today. The fact that, hey, if the number comes in weaker than expected tomorrow on non-farm payrolls, is that a boost maybe for equities because of the fact that we'll probably see yields start to fall on any bad number. And that might lend some support to the equity market. All right. Great discussion Craig."
