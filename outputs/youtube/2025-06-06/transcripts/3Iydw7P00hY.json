  "title": "NVIDIA Stock Price Analysis | Top $NVDA Levels To Watch for June 6th, 2025",
  "transcript": "Hi, this is Carrie Artekch with Wicked Stocks bringing you your daily Nvidia report for Friday, June 6th, 2025. Let's take a look at this chart. This is the big picture. I always like to start with the big picture and work my way into the day itself. It was two, four, six weeks ago today that we settled above this four or five month descending channel top at 99.46 then setting off a 3 to five month target at 150.69. We're 3 to 5 weeks into it and probably 80% of the way if not more to reaching our objective. We're having trouble in the mid uh 140s. Uh and that can be shown really kind of right here. uh that 14344 February high uh we pushed we actually test that test pushed through it by a bit about a week ago 14349 is the high from about a week ago pushed through that certainly on Thursday backed away uh we did not put out a key reversal high had we closed below Wednesday's low it would have been that would have been a slightly more bearish u framework but I don't really turn bearish honestly unless we were to close today below 3635. This 3-week rising channel bottom able to contain selling through next week. And yes, above which over the next week or two, we should reach our objective which begins at 150.69. Once again, this channel top here on the weekly chart and ends at the 152.52 rising channel top. We've been following this structure for weeks now and is now surpassed the 150.69 area. we will skew more toward 150.69 as our primary resistance. Uh in other words, as this channel top just continues into the 160s, uh we will use it as more of a session containment level uh and less of a trend defining upward pivot point. If over the next few weeks we can close above 150.69, then 17235 becomes the next 1 to two month target where we actually could place an annual high. But we're nowhere near any of those right now. And in fact, we've backed away having trouble in the mid 140s or the low 140s. 14344349 is still our resistance. If tested today may well contain intraday buying pressures and below which especially with the near key reversal high uh that's called a mini reversal in my book. 13635 is in reach today. Um, I don't necessarily expect it, but I definitely would not be surprised to see us test 13635 where once again you can buy this level on a day trade, a 3 to 5 day swing trade and a 1 to two week swing trade back up into uh the lower 150s where we can top out uh into possibly through July and fall away again. Um, and that is uh kind of the upside in a nutshell. Uh before I cover the downside, I just want to mention because I oftentimes forget that this week wicked.com put out three stock picks. Two on Thursday, Adobe Systems Dana Holdings. Uh Dana is a small cap stock. You want to check it out. We never present a stock pick unless we're confident that the buy signal that we're looking at can generate an underlying return in that stock of 20% or more. Both apply to Adobe and Dana. uh we give you the precise u locations, the precise levels, line studies to violate for initiating a long position. And also on Monday, Tempest AI, that is a medical AI stock. Uh also all three can be seen today by going to wickedtocks.com and taking advantage of our 5-day free trial. And with that, you'll see all of our stock picks. You'll also see our daily triple Q, our daily spy analysis, our weekly Apple stock. Our subscription allows you to see everything that we produce. There is no multi-tiered subscription. You get everything for one good price of $47 a month. 13635. If we close below it, we've got a good high for the month of June because over the next couple of weeks, I would expect 12224, this two-month rising channel bottom. Now, what should also be pointed out, a bit of a headscratcher, 13339 is its own channel support. And I have that as a session containment level can contain daily lows. If things get ugly today and we break 13635, 13339 is in reach where I would anticipate a daily low. And if we come off of 13339 and then close back above 13635, well then I'm still anticipating the low 150s over the next week. But as I said before, if we close below 13635 today, I think we've got a good high uh at least into later June, probably a good high for the month of June because we would spend the next week or two falling to 12224 and then it would take several weeks to push back to this high area. So yeah, a good June high if we close below 13635. Now, if you don't set a short until we close below 13339, I don't have a problem with that. That is a safer bet. Um, you know, sometimes those short-term horizontal structures wind up winning the day, so to speak, in terms of support. Uh, but I do like the 13635. It is trend defining support over the last three weeks. Can absorb selling through next week, and from here we can round up into the low 150. So, that is a 1 to two week swing trade to the upside. Now upside, I don't know if I've mentioned or not. If we close today above 14349, I do expect the low 150s within 3 to 5 days of doing so. So by later next week, if we settle today above 14349, and if you've yet to go long, uh that is your next uh buy signal on strength. If we close above 14349, I think you can expect 150.69 69 by the end of next week where you can take profits on that 3 to 5 day swing trade uh to the upside by closing above 14349. Until then, you can buy weakness at 13635 and now you have a 1 to two week swing trade into the low 150s. And as I said, closing today below 13635. Uh I don't see any compelling reason to stay long Nvidia. If your time horizon is anywhere from, you know, one to two weeks because over that twoe time frame 12224 would be anticipated. This two-month channel bottom able to contain selling then into quite possibly through July. And from here we can round up within 3 to 5 weeks or so up into the low 150s longerterm resistance that we show here. Obviously if over the coming you know uh uh couple two three weeks we close below 12224 that's a significant sell signal as we move into July. But there's no point in going there. I don't expect it. Uh and um I'm not even prepared to say how far south we would go then. But it would be a significant sell signal. Uh, please click like, share, subscribe. I think I've covered it all today. I am going to leave it at that for Friday's Nvidia. I will be back Sunday afternoon with Monday's Nvidia report. You have a great weekend."
