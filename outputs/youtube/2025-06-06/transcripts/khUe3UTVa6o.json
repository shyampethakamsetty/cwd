  "title": "Dressing LULU Earnings: China Resiliency and Innovation in Focus",
  "transcript": "week and still got some time left. We've got NFP tomorrow as well. It's time for the morning trade though. We're going to preview Lulu Lemon ahead of its earnings report. And for that we welcome in Schwab Network contributor Sam Vargas to help us with the setup. Sam good morning to you. Let's talk Lulu. You know I was pleasantly surprised that we hadn't got Lululemon earnings yet just because this is a company that I really think can set the tone for retail and consumer strength. What's on the minds of the street going into this one? Very good morning to you, Alex. Absolutely. And particularly given that retail's been a bit mixed throughout this earnings picture in this season. So as far as the stock is concerned looking somewhat muted. You could say ahead of this report card just sort of flip flopping between some fractional gains and fractional losses this morning. And perhaps that speaks to maybe some of the more tempered expectations that we've seen, given some of the crosscurrents, as we've been talking about everything from consumer sentiment to the macroeconomic picture and also these tariffs. Let me run you through the numbers as far as what we're expecting today. Adjusted EPs of 259 a pop on revenues of $2.36 billion. And it's really important. Something that I look at very closely is the composition of that. As far as the breakdown regionally, it is very important to look at what they've been doing in some of these stronger international markets like China. So the expectations going into this very much are for the Americas to rake in some $1.67 billion. That would then represent a plus 3% increase. But China, 369.7 million. That would represent a strong double digits once again of 22% higher. So not the sort of numbers that we have seen previously, but as I said, still double digit gains there. This is really huge business for this company, that particular market. I know I've lived there and they really have been capitalizing on that rising middle class. Also the demographic shifts as well. Over in China, people being more healthy rather than choosing to get married. But I'll park that there. But certainly as far as the stock is concerned, we did see a nice pop earlier this week. As you can see there. It did come off, of course, after Liberation Day, given some of the tariff exposure in markets like Vietnam, but because they've been sort of delayed and that can seems to have been kicked down the road, things have been recovering somewhat, but we have seen this little tick up off the back of some price target boosts ahead of this earnings report as well. Piper Sandler raising its target to 315 from 280, maintaining a neutral rating, and Evercore ISI raising its target to 400 from 320. So analysts very much seem to be encouraged right now, Alex, by some of those new product lines. I'm sure you're all across things like data drift, the most comfortable work pants and travel pants, you know, the pleated slouchy ones, and then the glow up collection, the activewear designed to be more soft and sculpting. I'm sure you're across that one. And then also the no visible line at the front to give it a sort of smoother look on those yoga pants. You know, I still think I have like shorts from Lululemon that I wear regularly that are from like 2014. So I don't know if that makes me an early adopter or just frugal. But nonetheless, I do wonder, and this will be my final question for you. I know you're not an analyst, but is the feeling that the growth is declining due to kind of the maturation of Lulu and the fact that it's grown so much? Or is this really a competitive nature story where you have names like Fiore or Alo or Outdoor Voices that have sort of replicated what they do now and perhaps even undercut them at some points when it comes to price. Yeah, I think there's a confluence of factors, as you pointed out, and I heard you and Jenny talking about this a little earlier with some of the competition. I mean, it really was an innovator at the start, but you have had these other companies that have come to market and doing things a little bit cheaper. And so you do have these sort of macroeconomic challenges as well, you know, whether people are still comfortable with paying that premium on going out and buying those yoga pants, that perhaps a higher price point. And it does very much seem to be a situation where they are sort of price competitive, and they've been able to justify that based on some of their new product lines, etc. But they have also been criticized for just how expensive some of their stuff is, particularly at a time when we've seen consumer sentiment while it is holding up, it does remain cautious and fragile. And these are sort of the comments that we've heard, even the CEO highlighting as well. Now, we also want to obviously hear what they have to say about the tariff situation. We've heard the news this morning, reportedly, of Trump and XI having this phone call that could influence as far as tariff policy, but this company has been pretty good as far as managing that exposure, moving some of that supply chain out of China over the years. I think it makes up for 3 to 6% or so now to places like Vietnam, which has also been, of course, the subject of those tariffs as well. But very much we want to hear what they have to say about some of those consumer trends and the competition, but also as well. Alex, the criticism has been while they have come out with these new product lines, as I mentioned before, they need to have more innovation, more product newness on the horizon. Sam, appreciate it. We'll catch up in about half an hour for the panel. Appreciate the setup here in Lulu as we say goodbye to Sam. We welcome in Joe Tigay, portfolio manager for the Equity Fund. Joe. First off, long time no talk. Good to see you. Thanks for joining me here this morning. Let's talk some Lulu. The stock's kind of middle of the range. And if you got some thoughts you want to share I know you got an example trade. Yeah definitely a big range. Yeah it's a it's been a great company. It's been a great story. Your comment that you last item you bought has been from 2014 kind of reminded me of Sam's remark. She said, In China, maybe people are choosing to be a little healthier rather than get married. I think that that remark describes me entirely. My last Lululemon purchases before my marriage. So I have a jacket from 2009 and a pair of shorts. So it's like, maybe it's a sign that the clothing is very well made and it holds up a lot while too. So that's certainly an option too. But it's just been a fantastic story. Recently. It was just 230, $235 at the end of March, so it's had a really great run up, but it's been in this range for the better part of three years. I think the high 530 low around the two 2230 area. So it's stuck in this range. I think this given the recent environment's very tricky. It's hard to really understand. I don't think we've had we would have had a really fantastic run up to just be shocked dramatically in this earnings report. I don't think we're going to get a bomb dropped on us on this. I think the market kind of is expecting something decent, but it's going to be hard to blow out the expectations, too, given all of the unknowns out there. So I think a cautious report is in line, and that kind of flies in the face of what the volatility look is looking like. Looking at the July or June excuse me options. We're looking at about a 66 vol on the at the money. So just as an options trader I'm just saying I don't really have an ax to grind lower higher. I'm just going to try to take advantage of this heightened volatility. I got two and a half weeks for this to play out through June, so I'm going to sell the three 3320 put spread, sell the three 4350 call spread. That's an iron condor. Just hoping for a muted reaction to this move. I've got a wide range of areas where I will win. And again, I'm only really risking $1.50 on this spread. It's going to collecting 850. So if we're close this this cycle in between 330 and 340, you get to collect all of that. 850 very likely over the next couple of weeks, I'll be looking to trade out of it for a smaller winner. Yeah. Talk to me a little bit about the management of something like this. Say you do get the sort of unchanged ish result, not perfectly unchanged, but somewhere within your break evens here you see volatility come down. What's a reasonable expectation for profit assuming your expectations are what play out. Yeah. So assuming we stay within this range we're staying above 330. Below below 340. Kind of in that in that area. Just very good opportunity. Just come in and take the trade off wholesale. Very likely to do it all at once. Now if there's a big move you might want to do it leg by leg. Do the call spread first. Do the put spread first depending on the direction that we're looking at. But yeah, just very likely on Friday morning we'll be looking at, you know, very lower vol we're going to be at, you know, from, from the 60s all the way down to the 30s, probably just overnight. So just very likely volatility will come in dramatically. And even if you know we're very we're we're you know one of the spreads is in the money. It's very likely that, you know the other leg is completely a huge winner and that the volatility is insomuch that it'll be very close to, to the spot. So I was kind of looking for a level. If it's a big move and I'm winning I'll just take it off. That's just a great great do. If it's a smaller move and it looks like, hey, if I just wait a little while longer, I got plenty more to gain here. I just might want to just leave it and let it breathe for a little longer. The nice thing is it is risk defined, you know, theoretically there too. So it gives you that added confidence, maybe for staying power, if there is a big reaction to normalize over the next few weeks. Joe TJ, really appreciate it. Thank you"
