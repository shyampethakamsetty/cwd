  "title": "GE Extends Its Run - What Can This Rally Teach Us About Trend Trading?",
  "transcript": "Jump over to GE. Just an absolute monster here in GE. Continues to run up. Drawing our fibs. I'll show you these. Cycle low. Cycle high. Cycle low. 1618 26293. That would be the next target back to the upside here in GE shortterm. Great move on the upside. A trough that's due at around 623. Um, you know, and again, you have to think about this. Actually, I was actually long GE right here. So, only made a little bit versus what was here. So this is an this is something that again we all have to really work on not missing opportunities like this. But this was the higher low here. This was your breakout. After that point what I want you guys to see are the small bodies in these candles all throughout this period. Generally speaking they're all small bodies down if anything. Right. And look at the number of days the underlying has held above the 8 day on a closing basis. It never closed below the 8 day from that day right here on 421 422. Not a single close below the 8 day. Again we we have to think about that distribution. Correct? normal distribution on a on a long time frame, right? Stocks behave randomly. What does that mean? That means, you know, if this is zero on a dayto-day basis, the overall distribution will be a little bit plus or minus around the zero line, right? But then you'll have tails on the upside, tails on the downside on a day-to-day closing basis. Now, that being said, trends happen in markets, right? So, that's only to be looked at on a on a day-to-day basis. The odds of not having any real actually bearish closes where every bar is higher than it opened is very low probability. But those low probability situations can give you signals to help you understand when to get on board. Do you understand what I'm saying? So what I like like to watch for instance is number of days over the 8th day. The more number of days that you see over an 8 day, and you have to obviously find that early, the more bullish it is, and the more likely you need to be trading earlier and only really be looking at mild dips. Most would say, \"Wow, this is this has moved a long way. How could you buy this? This is a setup.\" Why? Because look at the number of days over the 8day. Look at that right there. Pretty interesting. Pretty interesting. Why? Because these are opportunities. Okay, these are opportunities that I want to keep an open mind about. That retested the breakout area. So, while some would say, \"Wow, look how far it has gone.\" That's an an incorrect way of thinking. You have to be thinking about persistency of trends. What does that mean? That means how can you get on board and underlying when there is a persistent trend because those are the most powerful powerful moves. What I like to look at is trying to buy as close to that 8 EMA as possible. Why? because I have a clear stop level. It's always for me risk first. But this is a setup that for many people they would say this is very hard to buy. But that's why trends persist. That's why strong uptrends persist is because they're hard to buy. So we have to literally like flip our our mindset on its head, right? We can't use logic. We have to understand psychology. We're holding above the 8day. There are folks who are saying this has run way too much. This absolutely cannot go higher and they keep selling it. That's why these moves down are holding at very technical levels like the 8day, right? But these were those two opportunities right here. Again, clear stop. Correct. Clear stop. you're you're buying in into that spike versus the 21. So 214 215 versus 29 8 bucks risk, right? And right here, same thing. 8 day EMA trade long 229 versus 223, six bucks of risk. And what's critical, of course, too, is how it trades on that day. You need to get a cushion on that trade quickly. It needs to show buying versus that level. Both of these days showed buying versus the level. This is very important because you will see the absolute best trends. You know, we've all seen it. All of us are very quote unquote hard to buy. But there are setups if you do your homework to get on board persistent trends. And that is something that I really want to isolate um because um again we think about distribution and tails right they are random on a day-to-day basis. Occasionally you will see if this is zero right you'll see a day where it's positive where it's positive where it's positive but number of days consecutively where it's positive is a low odds situation but those low odds situations can give tremendous returns for your portfolio if you are ready and have a clear playbook set up for for you, not for me, for you for where you buy, where is your stop, and how do you manage that trade? So, let that be a little seed for thought for you guys to uh to really see if if that fits into your framework uh for your trading."
