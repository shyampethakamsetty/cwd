The severe scenario sees it at 1.5%. US stock index has turned negative now. in 10 minutes time. Now at the top of the hour we see the release of the Canadian IV PMI. Prior read was 47 spot 9. couple second areas, guys. I'll be on in just a moment here. So out the gate here, we're just seeing the S&P 500 down 0 spot 3%, the NASDAQ down 02% and the Dow down 0.3% as well down. They're going to head. We got to wait. [ __ ] Check. One, two, test. One, two. Oh, yeah. In 5 minutes time now at the top of the hour we see the release of the Canadian IV PMI for May. Prior read was 47 spot 9. We can go deeper by the way. Let's see if they'll uh they might get a bounce there at least. God, I was listening to this uh I was listening to this song in the shower. By the way, I'm late because I had to take a goddamn shower. Forgot to take a shower this morning. I was so excited about being up in the pre-market. I'm like, woo. The uh I was listening to this song called this. I don't know what the song is called, but it's like a a teenage boy and he's singing a song that's like, \"Bad things, all they want is bad things for me.\" And I'm like, \"No, they don't. They want you to go to school and get a job. That's what they want you to do.\" He's like, \"Oh, my mom loves me. Bad things.\" And I'm like, \"No, there's no bad things. They just want you to go to go to school, get an education, and be a productive member of society. I'm like, I sound like such an old man. I'm sure it's like an anthem for boys, you know. I got a uh you know, like mental health or whatever, but that's some [ __ ] my dad would say to me. Uhoh. Hold on. Not doing what I'm supposed to do here. Uh, no trend is not lost. What's happening here is that this this is all just mechanics. I'll explain this get to you guys in just a minute here. Hold on. I think I've said this a bunch, but I don't think people understand it. But hold on a second here. They don't want to understand it. You know who does understand it? Data gang understands it. You can usually tell like who knows who understands uh the option market and who doesn't but for the reason that we're right here right now. You can usually tell who understands the option market and who doesn't. So people are like why are we rolling right now? Usually they have a very base understanding like these are calls and these are puts. That's it. It's the it's Hold on a second here. Okay, one minute now until we get the Canadian IV PMI. Now, that's not to say we could not go up. There's no such thing as an absolute, but you need um you need call or you need a reason to buy calls off of the bell. But so we're up here. You can see we rejected. You see this rejection up here? Uh give me let me hold on a second here. You can see it in futures too. 48 spot 9. People are rolling uh futures higher too right now which is not good. Well, it isn't. It isn't. But I'm going to simplify this for you here. Hold on. I'm g make this really simple. All right, get the break time off here and um that went off. Apologize. I was so excited this morning. I uh didn't take a shower and I'm like like running around doing this and I'm all excited. I'm on Twitter. I'm like, \"Holy [ __ ] it's [ __ ] 9:00 a.m. like I got to then I'm like talking to the Discord and stuff.\" And we have posted the Canadian. Let's uh talk about something here. Live report on the feed for those interested. So I hope I think I've described this before. Uh different different success. So uh we have dealers, right? And not just dealers. We've got we can draw this out. You've got uh different participants in the stock market. Uh let's just say we've got institutions over here, right? Say you got hedge funds over here. You got retail over here. And then you got dealers. Now there's other groups in here, you know, there's other family offices and blah blah blah blah blah blah, whatever. Now, this is not the pie chart. Uh the line should be a little bit different. Like retail is not the largest group in here, but I want you to think about like um or at a base. You you want to think about uh the idea that sometimes you have funds, hedge funds in the market. Sometimes you have hedge funds and uh institutions in the market. Sometimes you have whales with retail in the market or you just have retail in the market. That's it. So you have like different groups that may be in the market at the same time or not at the same time and you have different groups that also want to do different things. That's important to remember. Uh what do they want to do there? Sometimes they're at odds with each other. Uh and then you've got dealers and dealers try to service these groups, right? Uh you want to buy a share or stock or you want to sell one or you want options to buy or sell. Uh they provide what? They provide liquidity to you, right? They're the dealer of last resort. they like they they serve as also as an intermediary. So if I've got a hundred uh call options that I want to sell or I want to buy, they'll put me in touch with somebody else. H this guy wants a hundred too and he's willing to pay a dollar and your ask is what a dollar2. Well, we'll put it up for a dollar two and if he wants to buy it and he will. He says [ __ ] you know I'm only putting in 98 cents or something. we're not you're not going to get a fill right now. There's also dealer of last resort. It's how you get your bid ask. Right. Um the dealers will offer you a price that's usually dog [ __ ] If there's no liquidity, you ever see the wide spread in an option, a stock that's not uh doesn't have a lot of volume in it or liquidity in it, dealers will be like, \"Oh, no, no. I'm not giving you no dollar, bro. I'll give you [ __ ] 50 cents.\" You know what I mean? Um so you've got all these motions going on in the market right now uh let's say let's say you get like retailers, hedge funds, institutions all buying shares, right? Or all buying ramping call options, right? Slam, slam, slam, slam. Uh dealers need to chase that, right? So they're all together at that point right now. The moment that everyone stops buying, uh dealers theoretically will try to offer or begin to sell, right? Well, well, that's technically not exactly true. Um, but as the like like they suddenly call us is like let's say it's like 400 and we're buying 400 C's, right? They'll do anything they can to try to get that price down. So they can get uh um neutral, right? Delta neutral on that trade. So um as a matter of fact, uh they don't want to print this either, do they? Unless you get more of these people that want to buy. So, like today the uh today on uh 6,000, you're not getting these people all buying there, are they? There's no trigger uh for continued buying, right? Um like, hey, we're all going to buy 6100 and 6200 and the dealers are going to send us up and over. Um they're not going to do that, right? Uh and dealers want to be up on you always, right? not up on you, but just neutral against your position whenever you stop doing whatever it is that you're doing. So, you know, like we're like we're like up here. Let's say it's like five, let's we'll just use this as 600, right? So, like you're buying buying buying or you get up here and then you trigger call buying above here. Uh and then they follow for a little bit and then once that's done, what happens? Price starts to fade again, right? Um, now and let's say you're buying 6100 and you've got a bunch of 60 or 610 calls. Dealers will print those, but they don't want to print them. And if they're going to print them, they need more more participants to print them. They need like a second round of bag holders. How this is where we get bag holders from. Uh, but if they're going to print them, they want them to be worthless once they print them. They want them to expire at zero, right? ultimately um they want all options to expire worthless. That's going neutral, right? I provide liquidity for you and this guy and that guy taking bets against or for or whatever. And you've got buyers and sellers and then you've got other participants that don't ever want to see this, right? The guy who actually uh created options under his underlying position. Uh he'll even dump shares if he has to against you too. There are like other forces in the market against you. um to not print these options until they're basically worthless or near worthless or even after they're dead. Um especially if we know that like participants are are sentiment is bullish or bearish or whatever. Um then they might not ever print them if sentiment turns the other way and the market starts to do like what instead of real money buying, real money selling, right? Um that's why sentiment matters in the market on especially where we are right now. Sentiment matters. um in a big big way. And also sentiment can shift depending upon where we are too, right? Uh if we're here uh at 600, there's no sentiment shift unless you get like news or something. Uh you'll you'll notice often times on ER, they'll ramp up in the overnight and then you're like, whoa, I'm going to get paid, right? And when we're coming down to the open, you're thinking that you're going to get paid. In reality, you need the or more uh you just call that M, right? Or or you'd need uh traders, right? But you'd need all like these traders. You need all of them plus more, maybe a little bit more uh to step in. I don't know if it's all of them, but you need a lot of them to step in and and and demand those options at the same time, even on the even on the open after an ER. As a matter of fact, for a brief moment, if you've ever been this situation, oftent times, let's say you've got a position that's worth a dollar over here, maybe you bought it for 10 cents. Oftentimes you'll see like your options maybe on the bell for a quick second if they're even if we're going higher. You'll see like ah maybe they're only up a$120 or 30 dollar 50 maybe you actually see the price like quickly come down and then it jumps back up again. Uh that's that horse trading moment, right? That's where arbitrage happens. Often times you can actually get in oftent times first like 5 minutes uh trying to get an option that was actually not up even with this move. You like you didn't even have to be in here for the risk. You could actually have just jumped on it the opening day the next day. Um, so my point here is that or my point I think I said a few things wrong here too but uh my point you getting the gist right that you need there's there's a few things here you can already see you know we keep selling this right you see that we're sell right sell in the US held a phone call with the latter you also have people closing ing options there too, don't you? At his request. So, you've got someone that maybe owns a 6000C or 600 C and what do they do? They try to get the money for it. Right. Right here. Right. Try to close out uh positioning too. So, those that's working against you as well, right? Um and there's something else here too. Um we are yet to hear any details from this she and Trump call. You need a reason to get any outline or readout from this call to roll higher. Uh you need news. You need something good and or you need an expiry. Uh so we have a weekly expiry coming up on Friday, don't we? Uh if I was going to print 6,000 this week, I would want to see one of two things. I would either want to see some kick-ass news, right? What what would you what would you think that would be? So, let's look at where we are right now, right? What would make what would what would what would instigate a move higher and then continuation? Some good news, right? Some really good news. Really good sentiment, I would expect, right? Hey, we got a trade deal with China would do it, wouldn't it? You'd get everybody. Oh [ __ ] we're going to get squeezed out. I gotta get long. I got to short on the market. I got to get long. I don't want to get squeezed, right? Hedge funds, right? Institutions, retailers. Woo! We're going to kill volatility. Let's all pile in. So, everybody's freaking out, right? FOMO, right? And then dealer dealers magnify or amplify that move higher, right? Give me six. Give me uh 100 620s. Give me another 100. Give me another 100 pack of those 630s up there. Uh go down there in the bottom. Give me a bottle of the uh the good stuff down there. Oh yeah, I'll take that too. You know what I mean? See like by the way bunch of I got take spy shares. You know what I mean? We're going to the moon, baby. And everybody's running in the store trying to, you know, scoop up everything off the shelves and dealer's like, \"Okay, okay.\" Right. In Japanese, I'll take a little bit myself. dealer shoving some some cartons of we want full US whatever down their thing so you kind of need that too right can't just be uh hey we're at 6,000 why are we not popping over it doesn't work like that so uh now people are rolling their positions higher here um and higher and if they are going to print 6,000 they're likely going to do it uh If it's not like event driven, uh they would probably do it uh either Friday or even Monday or Tuesday. Now, remember, we've got uh some other issues here, too. Uh we've got a magnets below us with OPEX and collars and stuff like that. Those will become more important as we get closer, but it's still there. Even right now, there's like a drag on the market. So, uh, we've got some OPEX stuff, expiration stuff, uh, that that's coming more and more and more like timewise more and more into focus, uh, to the downside, believe it or not. There it's like a it's like, um, what would you call it? Like a, um, kind of like a drag, right? There's a drag on the market just for where options are too on a quarterly basis that's working against the market going higher. Uh now when we get out of quarterly opex, the market's free for a moment to do whatever it wants to do, right? As more options come into the market, the market begins to like lay out a a play area, for lack of a better word, um until something changes. So, uh this is expected today, believe it or not. We thought this would happen at the end of the day today or not end of day, but we're like, today we're going to hit this, right? And so let's go look at the trigger screen and what expectations were. And so this is expectations. Get rid of this. So this was yesterday's expectations for today. And these are expectations right here. And I always try to think of this like a dealer. So I'm like, we should probably print right here today. That's 4 p.m., right? And what did dealers do? They printed it when you couldn't get the money from options. They did it in pre-market. Sorry suckers. There's your print. How's that feel? That sucks, doesn't it? This is also a function of uh the summer trade. Uh, it's why I like spreads, too, because we grind and then we'll hit a high and you won't get paid for it. So, you got to wait till the next level up to get paid for it. Um, now they did it. Now, there's a chance we could come come back up here and try to hold our asses up into the close here. Maybe we'll print that high one more time end of day. That's still viable today, but we don't have to either. Uh and but and I'm thinking, hey, let's trade let's or let's uh print this, right? End of day when these options are worthless again, murder them all day long, maybe run it back up. Um and then uh you've got every and you've also got another thing in here where you've got people that are trying to hedge this NFP. That's not MP, but NFP. And this is a perfect a perfect time to do it, right? where this is 9 or 930 right here 930. So if you were going to hedge NFP if you own underlying SPY or an underlying position anywhere else pretty good price right? Uh that was 9 that was 5975 pretty nice uh place to print right. Uh the other thing too is we didn't print the high yesterday on SPY. So we got it here on SPY this morning. That's good to see. Um so if you're like hedging doom on Friday, unrealized volatility, I would have been slamming if I own spy on this bell. I would have been slamming these the the uh you know 5-cent or 1 cent uh puts personally uh for Friday, some really cheap. But I don't own spy right now. So, um I did not do that this morning, but it was it's a it's a reasonable place to do it, right? You're over here and you're hedging from here. Uh you know, not bad, right? And because you're getting those hedging flows, you're getting an early gift, aren't you? Now, if those flows stop today, right, all those put flows stop, dealers will likely try to counter trade it, won't they? And if they don't do it in cash market, they will likely try to do it after hours, believe it or not, run this up again. So, that that hedge is worthless by the time we get there, right? You need more put buying. You need realized volatility, right? So, they're constantly working against you, right? Constantly. It's like a fluid thing. Now, if we were going to print 6,000, we'd probably, in my view, do it. You come down here, right? Blood you down a little bit more and just even even we just fade this and then just ramp over. There's your 600 and then we wait for an announcement over the weekend. So, let's say that some people know that we're going to get an announcement over the weekend that's positive. All right. Come back down into Monday morning. And guess what? I got the nice new high. I don't pay any any I got the theta burn going on. Dealers are happy. Sorry, [Music] suckers. I hit your 6,000 here. I got you up here. You've already been rolling or you've been rolling higher to 6100. You're not getting a print. You need more people to buy them, bro. You need more people to come up here and buy them. And I'm going to fade you again, too. I'm going to sell into up there again. So, this is a constant battle in the stock market, right? Um, and it's amplified a lot right now in summer. uh mostly because spy is used as a or S&P is used as a hedge not spy particularly but storage change the forecast is for a build of 113 BCF on the prior build of 101 BCF spies like this is not the high high time of year for spoos uh there's a rotation going on into what right now tech right so if I'm buying a bunch of shares is in Microsoft or Google or Tesla whatever mag the soup dour right now is mag seven rotating through mag 7 where do I hedge spoos easy peasy especially in cash market right some some zero dates one day puts um so this is like the kind of like the redheaded stepchild of the market this time of year doesn't mean it doesn't go up it just means that it goes up slowly then you get bursts of up, right? Trade sideways, burst of up, sideways, burst of up. Sideways, burst of up, right? Sideways. And it's like the slow, slow, slow, slow grind until the trade is over elsewhere. And then where do we go? Down, right? Um, so that's what spoos is. We've been uh talking about stocks in the in the in the Discord, right? Uh even on Twitter, I'm like, \"Hey, rotate into this one, then rotate into that one, then rotate into this one.\" Uh meanwhile, we're in spreads on spoos, right? We're on spreads with limited upside. Um trying to capture a summer trade. Put on a spread, close your laptop. you want to trick day trade, pick up some uh options or underlying on individual tech tickers. This has been pretty good. So, if you're wondering what's going on here, is this the top of the market? The answer is no. You're wondering, was that the top? No. This is they're they're still working in the market right now. There's still like there's still a trade on elsewhere in the market. Um so, let's watch what happens here. We'll see if this holds. This should hold, by the way. Um, it's possible we could hit the 90 91, but I don't think so. Uh, as a matter of fact, uh, you're getting a deal again. All right. Buyers, buyers, buyers, buyers, buyers, buyers. Right. What are we doing right now? Buyers. Um, so you know, if you're trying to maybe put on a trade for Friday close and you don't think we'll realize volatility tomorrow or if you put an in the money call spread maybe and if we go up here and maybe we fail and we fade the day at two two o'clock for an FP tomorrow because this goes we go risk off tomorrow. You know that, right? uh bulls, bears, everybody goes risk off on NFP normally um because of the uncertainty and there's easier trades. But let's say we get no realized V, then we're going to go up, right? Um so you could do something that's in the money, couldn't you? like, \"Oh yeah, I'm going to do a 93 to 95 or a 93 to a 99 for an expiry on Friday or even Monday to buy yourself a little bit more time, right? We come up here a little bit of doom. They run it up here right over on Monday, Tuesday. Cash them out on Monday open, right? We have a little bit of down move on Monday, Tuesday.\" Prince Muhammad Bill and Salman spoke on the phone. You know what I'm saying? And look at this. We're coming right back. Shocker. All of a sudden, we're coming right back. Another thing to note here would be right around uh 230. Matter of fact, should we do this together? Let's do you want to look at some of this here? Let me just check some really quick. Just let me check. Right in there. Whoa. So, this 4 hour right here is important. So, we could even uh we almost went down there already. Yeah, we we almost hit that one. 593. That's good. We're likely not going any deeper. Likely. It may not go anywhere though. In 5 minutes time now, at the bottom of the hour, we see the release of the EIA natural gas change for the week. The forecast is a build of 113 BCF on the prior build of 101 BCF. Could just park this right in here all day long. I'm just parking this right here. Just wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, wham, grind up, grind up, and then down at like 2:30 in the afternoon. We've got this prior high right here. Uh right here we got [Music] um that's trend. Remember yesterday we said in trend we were talking about trend and I said to you remember the remember yesterday I said up this is trend. I said we can go up here we can go down here. We're still on trend. Right. We got that one right there and we got this big bad. Look at that. Look at that big bad boy right there. We got this bad boy right here. Whole lot of sellers up here, huh? whole lot of get me some protection for NFP, bro. Still have a little bit of volatility. Could that be the trigger? Could the Could like a deal with China and good unemployment employment numbers tomorrow be the right cocktail to get us over some relief? I think this morning, Uncle JBJ, what did he say this morning? He made he said something really cool. He said [Music] um what did Uncle JBJ say this morning? I think he was pretty succinct this morning. He said um and I don't know what his politics are either. I think he might even be um kind of conservative, but he made a good point. He said I think this is barely everyone's sentiment no matter where you are on this. Um, what did he say this morning? I'm going to read what he said. He said, wait. He said, \"I just want it all to end.\" He goes, \"I just can't. I'm closing the laptop. I can't listen to the on and off stuff. And I would believe that even no matter what your what you want or don't want that like as a market participant, it's it's a little overdone, isn't it? Like some of you like it. Some of you like, I love the onoff because market moves, right? But a lot of sentiment out there from retailers, not real traders, but just the retail sentiment because I've had enough, right? I don't want headline risk anymore. I don't want on and off trade. Some people like that trade, right? It's they call it the taco trade. You know, if you don't know what taco trade is, uh these guys just wait for bad news. The moment you get a bad headline like uh I don't know we're going to do 400% tariffs on China market dives down to the depth but bottom they buy that they run it right back up again and they get out and then they wait for more bad news that's the taco trade generally basically that's taco trade matter of fact they do it on the opposite side too so if you get some like good Trump news and market rips to new highs uh they will sell that high too, right? Um, so that works in both ways. That was common in CO too. Uh, during CO, uh, we called it the Gina trade. Some of you remember this, some of you don't. Um, it was, uh, Gina trade deal on again. Ghana trade deal off again. If any of you are participants pre-COVID, you know that what this trade is. Um, some weakness in natural gas there after the larger than expected storage build. Some of you might not know remember that trade because you weren't in the market then, but some of you do. Uh so that's the taco trade two would be um Ghana trade deal on again, Ghana trade deal off again. So um my point here is that um we need we need something, right? Uh for the market to go higher and the market's waiting for it, isn't it? Uh, the market's just waiting for anything. Can you give me like a truce in Ukraine, Russia? Can you give me some trade deal news? As a matter of fact, I would bet that it doesn't matter what the trade deal is, the market will explode to the upside. Uh, because once that's in stone, like I don't I don't even know if we can get it in stone. I got to be honest with you, like thinking of it right now, I'm like they don't want it to be in stone to some extent for a bunch of different reasons. Uh that's mostly with like debt ceiling, um deficits, spending bills, uh and trade war tariffs. It's like it's all like it all it all needs to be one way or we need we need to know what it all is, I guess. Um the the tariff the trade deal in particular needs to be done before we're passing any spending bills or debt sealing limits any of that kind of stuff. Let's be honest or at least the majority of it needs to be done to some extent. Um and they're trying to back door some [ __ ] in the spending bill in case they can't get the trade deal done. like the White House is trying to do like um let's put in some new rules and we'll try to we're not going to make a trade deal and we're going to pass the spending bill and you know they're all both coming to deadline to deadlines. We have posted out the weekly EIA natural gas storage report on the feed for those interested. And so there's like uh there's a lot of there's a lot of uh well if we can't get a trade deal done let's just get done let's get let's get some more ammunition or some more guns and ammunition uh in the spending bill and of course told the Saudi crown prince that he is determined to strengthen ties. Of course, everyone's aware, you know. Um, so there's so the market's telling, uh, the White House, get this [ __ ] deal done. You're not getting anything passed until you do. Um, and that's where we are. So, uh, I'm with JBJ on this. I think Winky feels like there's a whole bunch of different people are like just like, uh, they want some kind of like something in stone. I think the market can't go higher until that happens either. um or even permanently high. Not even permanently, but if the markets like recover and go higher the rest of the year, uh you need some kind of closure to that. Now, we have two windows for it. We've got a window right now, uh and we have a window end of year, uh September, October. So, uh we've got some debt sealing stuff coming up for the summer. We've got uh uh UN and whatever EU [ __ ] going on. And then we've got um uh spending bills, all that kind of [ __ ] like comes to a head in June, July. And uh even if we have a shutdown or whatever, it doesn't matter. Uh there's we we're in that window right now. Uh so if you want to see this actually probably impacts the whole year. Um if you want to see like that higher trade for early summer and then a nice all-time high end of year or higher, we probably need a [ __ ] trade deal uh this summer. If we don't get it, uh, we they will [ __ ] around with us, we will trade sideways and down until it's done. More than likely, there's a high probability of that happening. Um, we would not break higher and we would likely fade in that uh early in June and then July, we'd fade down below probably see a new market lows. Fair chance of seeing a new market low. U now, I'm sure the White House is aware of this. I'm sure that's Jerome is and you know Bessant and everybody's aware of all this. Um and it also provide clarity to the Fed too. There's a whole bunch of different mechanics there like Fed bond markets uh Treasury Department uh businesses uh uh small, medium and largeiz businesses all want an it's like all participants want an answer to this. So we'll see how that goes. And they're parking it. Oh god, this is going to suck watching this happen all day long today. It's going to be a pain in the ass watching this. It's going to be a nose an eye bleeder. Um, so we await uh trade deal or no trade deal uh from now into Friday. Uh I think we get one. It looks like the market is set up for some kind of trade deal or some kind of an announcement or pushing it off for six months or a year or something. uh if you don't get a trade deal, I would hope that they would do something into September. Maybe if they were to do a trade summit or something, maybe like they'd say, \"Oh, yeah, in the fall we're going to do a trade summit. We're going to I don't know, pause everything for a few months, that could help the market uh stay slightly up, but maybe we don't go down the actual depths of L.\" Says the US should withdraw its measures against China. Well, now if we don't get a trade deal, she says the US again should remove negative measures on China. If we don't get a trade deal, you know what that means, right? No pause, no trade deal, no nothing. Uh if we like roll into like open trade war, um it's bad. Um and I think that we eventually go into that, but I don't think it's today. increase cooperation on the economy and trade. Again, US and China should increase cooperation on the economy and trade as CCTV is releasing a readout of the she and Trump call now. Just waiting for more headlines to come through. Mexico's president Shane is to talk steel tariffs with Landau on June the 11th. CCTV report as well. The US and China should reduce misunderstandings. I think ultimately we still go down that path like the ultimate path of um changing our economy and dependence upon China. Um but it's not normally in the in the time frame that everybody wants it like like you and I or whatever like we're do it today. Get it all done today. Price it all in. Send spy down to zero. It's not how it works. So, um, tells Trump, uh, that China implemented the Geneva Agreement. Listen to this closely here. So, Z saying the US should remove negative measures on China. Uh, those are fighting words. We're getting close on fair and greed. We're at greed right now, but we're not we're not overly greedy. China also saying the US and China should increase cooperation on economy. also said CCC CCTV saying US and China should reduce misunderstandings. Oh, dude. Larry Frink. You like Larry Frink's [ __ ] op-ed piece? Oh. Larry Frink being like altruistic is kind of like um like it's it's like uh it's like uh it's like asking Elon Musk about family values. Like it's like talking to the devil. It's actually not a good look uh for White House. Uh still a little talk about says China's Xi said that Trump is welcome to visit China again. That's positive. That's actually good. They dropped the first couple things are kind of negative. China's President Xi says both sides should enhance exchanges. By the way, this is not what the market wants to hear. If you want to know, Chinese President Xi says the two sides should enhance exchanges in diplomatic, economic, trade, military, and law enforcement. The US has no interest in that. Market parked right now. We're waiting more news. Hold on. Talking to the uh prot traders really quick. see this really quick. Just check the chain here. Chain is really light too. Kind of light. She says it is important to dispel disruptions to the China US relationship and says that she and Trump agree to start a new round of talks ASAP. Again, China's President Xi and Trump agreed to start a new round of talks ASAP. Seeing some strength in the S&P 500 and the dollar here. So again, China's President Xi and Trump agreed to start a new round of talks ASAP. The consensus has been positive, by the way, abide by it, according to CCTV, citing China's President Xi. Again, China's President Xi says a consensus has been reached and both should abide by it. Whoa. Jesus Christ. There's a lot of call volume coming in right now. A lot of call volume coming in right now. Trade consultation mechanism. Lot of IO ROI and IV here. All volatility here. China's President Xi says the US should deal with Taiwan cautiously. You don't have to deal with Taiwan [ __ ] cautiously. The NASDAQ 100 here rising spot 4% to a session high. S&P 500 now in the green up around 0.1%. China already [ __ ] knows that if war breaks out, they don't get the chips either. They would [ __ ] grind to a halt. So, as this is coming through, just uh worth keeping in mind that we are getting some press conference from Trump at around 11:30, 11:45ish as he greets Germany's Chancellor Mertz at the White House. So, we're expecting to hear comments from Trump regarding this China call around that time. So, did you hear that? 11:30 to 12:30ish. corporation is the only right choice for China and the US. I like how they're like 11:30 12:30. Uh we're going to get a um we're going to get a Trump call 11:30 12:30. Just just a note here. 11:30. China's President Xi says the US and China should avoid conflicts because of Taiwan. there there. No, there there's not going to be any conflict for now. Not until you can make your own chips. The moment you can make your own chips, we'll put this in yellow. We'll put this here in yellow. What I heard was 11:30 to 12:30. China's President Xi says the US should avoid a very small number of Taiwan independent separatists, dragging China and the US into dangerous situations of conflict and confrontation. Our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined. We will be represented by the secretary of treasury bessent and lutnik from the commerce secretary. USR's Greer as well will be there during the conversation. President Xi graciously invited the first lady and himself to visit China and I reciprocated as president of two great nations. This is something that we both look forward to doing. The conversation was focused almost entirely on trade. It's gonna be hard to get up here by the way. It's gonna be a hard hard get up there. will inform the media as to scheduling and locations as soon uh as that is arranged. So just looking into the some of the key points then. So he did note that their respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location. This is R1 by the way. So again this is Trump on Truth Social. He said we'll be represented by Secretary of Treasury Bessent, Commerce Secretary Lutnik and USR's Greer as well. Coming into R1. This might be top here. So that last part was pretty positive. We had uh we have an agreement here. Uh we have the call lasted approximately one and a half hours and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries. There should no longer, this is from Trump, the call lasted approximately one and a half hours and resulted in a very positive conclusion for both countries. There should no longer be any questions respecting the complexity of rare earth products. Truth Social. Uh he also went on to say I spoke with uh our respective teams will be meeting shortly at a location to be determined. We will be represented by Secretary of Treasury Bessant, Secretary of Commerce Lutnik, and US TR Ambassador Greer. Um, that's all I'm seeing at the moment. That might be top right there. You see that last tick right here? That might be the trade. Oh, it's still alive, but we'll watch it. Let's see if we can get up here and just get the high tick. If we do get the high tick here, uh, trade could be dead dead. So, in 10 minutes time now at the top of the hour, US Commerce Secretary Lutnik due to be testifying to the House panel. Uh, Lutnik is also testifying. I'll have him on today, too. I'll have him on until Trump starts to speak. Trump also saying the conversation was focused almost entirely on trade. Nothing was discussed concerning Russia and Ukraine or Iran. But I think Trump already said that he spoke to Russ or he already spoke to Z about no he spoke to Putin about Iran. Uh he also says Trump also said um we will inform the media as to scheduling and location of the soontobe meeting. That's all from Truth Social. I'd give it a mixed bag. I'd give it if it was like a 10 was great and a zero or one was bad. So, we have posted out the live video of US commerce secretary Lutnik who's due to testify to the House panel. Again, that's at the top of the hour. I'd give it like a five or a six. It wasn't horrible. Not quite neutral. I've got Lutnik on right now whenever whenever he shows I don't see any other tweets right now. Um Trump also going on to say call with Zbore positive revol results for the US and China. So Trump is all over um truth social right now. I'm going to have to make a true social account. I didn't want to do that. I'm getting alerts on TM right now. RBRK cranked, huh? VG cranked. Alab, uh, AB had a down. They had a good day yesterday, but they went down for a little bit. Yeah, ASPI is looking good again. IE is looking good. 5 minutes time now at the top of the hour. US Commerce Secretary Lutnik is due to be testifying to the House panel. We do have the live video on the feed for those interested. Spy creeping higher yet again. like like all the Trump uh all the Trump reposter uh handles aren't working, huh? None of the Trump reposter handles are working. I'm going to have to get a true social account. I didn't want to get one because they wanted to identify me and I'm like no or they I think they wanted me to upload a license. I was like I'm doing that for you. I wouldn't do that for any Well, I had to do it for Twitter. Yeah, Trump is supposed to get Lutnik. So, see this yellow right here? So, this yellow is Trump speaking. They gave him a window like an hour window. So, we're going to have Lutnik on here in just a minute and then uh we'll get uh we'll roll right into Trump speaking. The I'm assuming this is going to move markets. So, his true social account is looking positive right now. Um I would go risk off once he comes on and start start speaking if he goes off script or anything. Uh It seems positive is true social account, but it could be like an operative that's tweeting for him right now. Let's go. Get up there and hit it, man. Just [ __ ] hit it. Tap it. Touch it. Just creep on up there. You can pull right back. You go right. You don't even All you have to do is go up here and go right back down, bro. Just Just touch it a little bit more. Little tiny bit more. Just a teensy ween see a little bit more. Want to see where we're trying to hit right here on SPX. Try to tag uh 5987.88. 5988 comments from US Commerce Secretary Lutnik as he testifiers to the House panel. Again, live videos on the feed. A little little tiny bit more. Yeah, that well agreed. It's like Supergal like Hold on a second. I got the um like the the problem with Tai or Taiwan right now, the major problem is that China's like catching up with chip production, but they're not quite there. Whenever they get there, I'm assuming war will begin. So, the US had to sell $22 billion in reopened 30-year bonds on June 12th, settling on June 16th. But for right now, at this moment, in threeyear notes on June 10th, settling on June 16th, 52- week bills, they're selling $48 billion on June 10th, settling on June 12th. And as for 6 months, just hit it. 48 billion June 9th, settling June 12th. and three-month bills selling 76 billion. June 9th again settling on June 12th as well. [ __ ] pull back. Just hit that [ __ ] thing. Keep in mind, commerce secretary Lutnik currently testifying to the House panel. The US is also to sell $39 billion in a reopen 10 year not sell June 11th. Uh thank you to our subcommittee members and to Secretary Lutnik for being with us today for a good while. The fiscal year 26 budget request comes at a time of continued fiscal pressure. Uh we must ensure every American taxpayer dollar is used efficiently and continue to uh work to reduce duplication across agencies uh and throughout the government. The Department of Commerce's budget request totals 8.4 billion. Is this the guy that couldn't count billions the other day? Billion dollar or 17? I think this is that guy from the current level. The budget request uh includes funding for targeted investments in tools to address unfair trade practices and emphasizes important initiatives such as American manufacturing and trade enforcement. We did get a new high there. It includes a 50% on the high from 1046 of industry and security to counter threats from China and protect America's technological competitiveness. The budget request also includes a 20% increase for the Census Bureau to continue providing reliable statistics overall. This is the prior high from uh 9:30. This is the opening bell here. Security, economic growth and job creation, weather research and response, and economic data analysis. All keystones imperative to American prosperity. On the international front, the department plays an important role in protecting our industries from one-sided trade practices and strengthens supply chains that are key to ensuring our economic security and global uh leadership. I've always been a big supporter of the Department of Commerce. Uh the department's core initiatives are vital to smalltown economies across the country, including my district in Eastern Kentucky. One of the most critical components of revitalizing rural America, is expanding access to high-speed, reliable broadband. In far too many places, a lack of broadband access is not just an inconvenience. It's a barrier to education, job creation, entrepreneurship, and even basic health care. From EDA's emphasis on job creation and expanding economic opportunity to Noah's local weather forecast offices that work around the clock to send out alerts during times of severe weather, the department's wide ranging responsibility requires clear prioritization and accountability. We look forward to hearing from you, Mr. Secretary, on how this budget request furthers our shared goals of reducing wasteful spending, ensuring global competitiveness, expanding broadband, and driving economic development. Let me now recognize my ranking member of the subcommittee, Miss M. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, for testifying today, and as a fellow New Yorker, congratulations. Uh we met today, we meet today to discuss the Commerce Department's fiscal year 2026 budget request. At the same time, I must express my strong disappointment that we are still awaiting the complete details of the budget request. We are also awaiting the full legally required details of the Commerce Department's fisc year 2025 operating plan. Despite the fact that such details were legally required to be sent to our appropriations committee more than a month ago, these delays are unacceptable. They are also disturbingly a pattern that we have seen over the last four and a half months. A pattern of significant and often illegal actions by federal agencies including the Commerce Department. In most cases, we have learned of these actions not from the department itself, but from news media reporting and from grant and contract recipients whose critical grant funding and contract extensions have been delayed or frozen. often in direct violation of the Empowerment Control Act of 1974. We have also heard from numerous federal workers who have been fired without any good justification. The National Weather Service has taken a huge hit under this administration. Hundreds of meteorologists and other weather service employees were fired or felt pressured to sign up for Elon Musk's deferred resignation program. As a result, the National Weather Service has been scrambling to keep a minimum staff at weather forecast offices around the country. This staffing shortage has also forced the weather service to reduce its deployments of weather balloons, which have long provided critical information for accurate weather forecasting in local areas. This is all happening, by the way, right when both hurricane season and wildfire seasons are just beginning. The weather service announced earlier this week that it is moving its limited resources around, which will only change the locations that are experiencing staffing shortages. It has also announced that it has received permission to hire 126 new employees. But this is obviously far short of the number of working employees the weather service has lost since February. It is unclear when these new employees will be onboarded, let alone when they will be fully trained to the level of performance of the recently departed weather service employees. Five former directors of the National Weather Service who served under both Republican and Democratic administrations wrote an open letter last month expressing their strong concerns. They wrote that National Weather Service staff, quote, will have an impossible task to continue its current level of services, not only are there fewer forecasters, but there are also fewer electronic technicians responsible for maintaining the critical NEXRAD radars. Our worst nightmare is that weather forecast offices will be so understaffed that there will be needless loss of life,\" unquote. The administration is also holding back various emergency designated fiscal year 2025 commerce department funds. This is funding that Congress appropriated to support weather forecasting, create and preserve American private sector jobs and protect our national security. Holding this funding back is unacceptable and the administration should issue the required emergency designations immediately. The administration and the commerce department have released some initial details regarding their fisc year 2026 budget request, most of which I find greatly concerning. For example, the administration is proposing to end funding for the Economic Development Administration or EDA. Contrary to your testimony at your Senate confirmation hearing in which you answered that you would maintain the programs at EDA. As you know the EDA helps create jobs and economic opportunities and distress communities across the country and historically twothirds of its budget has helped create jobs in rural areas. The administration is also proposing to end funding for the Minority Business Development Agency or MBDA. Again, contrary to your testimony uh in which you answered that you did not support dismantling MBDA. In addition, contrary to the Trump administration's stated goal of bringing manufacturing jobs back to America, the Trump administration is proposing to eliminate funding for the manufacturing extension partnership program, a successful bipartisan program that helps small and medium-sized US manufacturers in every state grow and improve their operations and create jobs. Furthermore, the budget request further effectively cuts the operating budget of the National Weather Service in 2026. It creates a real risk of a future gap in critical weather satellite data. This needless needlessly risks lives, property, and public infrastructure around across the country. I'm losing the stream here. Hold on. No, this is live right now. Be tighter. I'm losing the stream. discussing these and other concerns at today's hearing. And again, thank you very much, Mr. Secretary, for your testimony today. Thank you, Miss Ming. Uh, I would now like to recognize our witness, Secretary Lutnik. Am I pronouncing that correctly? Let me uh for an opening statement. Thank you. Without objection, your written statement will be entered into the record and we hope you can summarize uh in five minutes. I'll do my best. Thank you, Chairman Rogers, Ranking Member Ming, and the members of the subcommittee. It is an honor for me to join you today. America is once again the most attractive destination for investment in the world. Under President Trump's leadership, the Department of Commerce is strengthening American industry from the most popular to those industries that have been long ignored. We are focused on building in America and driving our economic growth, which will narrow the deficit and we will deliver a new era of American innovation. Businesses are no longer looking overseas. They are choosing to invest in America first. Through the president's executive order establishing the investment accelerator in the Department of Commerce, we have already secured trillions of dollars of new commitments from worldclass companies and sovereign wealth funds eager to build and invest in the United States. This surge in investment paired with renewed commitment to fair and reciprocal trade is reigniting Americans manual. This is Lutnik right now. We are bringing car manufacturing back to Michigan and Ohio. We are reopening steel mills in Pennsylvania. And just last month, Arizona welcomed the largest semiconductor investment in the United States of America, thanks to an investment of TSMC. The first chips deals that we are improving have now have commitments more than doubling the $300 billion of investment in America. And that's without spending any more taxpayer dollars than those CHIPS funds that you've already approved. So our commerce department is driving substantial investments across America and benefiting the American taxpayers. Critically, the president's America first agenda goes beyond just economic growth and investment. The president is taking concrete actions to protect American workers and our national security. Under section 232, the Commerce Department is conducting numerous investigations to protect, to reshore, and to revive manufacturing capacity across our critical industries here in America. The Trump administration is imposing tariffs and ending loopholes. In April, we ended the dimminimous loophole which allowed foreign companies to avoid paying tariffs on small shipments which basically undercut American small business. New export controls are protecting cutting edge technologies and finally protecting our critical industries and protecting American innovation. In fact, the Bureau of Industry and Security, working with our partners in the Department of Justice, we've secured 22 criminal convictions, 32 arrests, 38 indictments, 231 detentions, and and seized more than 185.5 million, and then we did other types of seizures for another $40 million. Under this administration, the US Patent and Trademark Office is tackling a mountain of unexamined patent applications left by the Biden administration. Almost 800,000 unreed patents uh applications, successfully reducing the inventory backlog for the first time in four years. In the past four months alone, we have removed 50,000 fraudulent goods and services from the trademark register that block the use of legitimate products by American businesses. Many of these purported trademarks came from what they call specimen farms that are fake websites displaying products that don't really exist. At Noah, we are transforming how we track storms and forecast weather with cutting edge technology to improve the understanding and prediction of how hurricanes and testify intensify. This season, Noah's research centers will deploy new small aircraft drone systems and additional underwater colliders. This year, the National Weather Service will be running an experimental AI based forecast system, and all data we will make publicly available. Today, this commitment to innovation means earlier warnings and increased accuracy for Americans, no matter where they live. For far too long, Americans have been unfairly treated by foreign nations because we allowed them to take advantage of our markets to the detriment of our own industry and Americans. Thanks to President Trump and this administration's efforts, we are reversing this trend by reshoring critical manufacturing, eliminating unfair trade barriers and practices, and investing in our American workforce. With your help, we will deliver growth and prosperity across our great nation. I deeply appreciate you inviting me here today, and I look forward to answering your questions and talking together. Thank the secretary for those words. Uh we have a full complement of members of the subcommittee with us this morning. There's a little bar higher up here. Do our questioning under the five minute rule. So Mr. Secretary, thank you for being here. I yield myself. Watch out for a squeeze. You touched Oh, there it goes. somewhat already, but I wanted to ask you about uh the Chinese Communist Party uh and their effect in this country and our bipartisan concern. From economic warfare to technological threats, China uh is seeking to obtain advantage of our nation uh our people and our companies at all possible opportunities. Um, again, summarize what we're doing to strengthen our ability to counter China's unfair trade practices, protect America. Target is 59864, and secure critical supply chains and emerging technologies. The Chinese Communist Party uh seeks to become new market high culture of the world and it uses our knowledge, our innovation and our entrepreneurial spirit against us. It sends hundreds of thousands of students to train and learn here in order to build up their capacity to grow. They copy uh our innovations. Uh for example, if you see their airplanes, gosh, they look just like the F-22. Um because they've copied our models and our systems. They are trying to copy our technology. And in the race for AI supremacy, they are behind us, but they are working with a central government out to get us right to beat us so that they will have intellectual superiority over us. There is an AI race and BIS, our bureau, is at the heart of protecting America. And that's why we've sought an increase in the budget. Even though we're decreasing our overall budget, we need to arm the Bureau of Industry and Security to protect us and to help us keep key industries away from the Chinese so that they can't just copy us all the time. The budget request for BIS does not specify any specific initiatives related to increasing almost there is posing a threat to US national security. Uh why is that so? I' I'd be happy to uh detail it either here or in writing, but the idea is to add enforcement agents, agents who carry weapons, agents who go and examine warehouses, examine those people who are exporting, examine the imports, find the particular items and make sure we have export controls are rigorously enforced. So that is the specific use of the funds is more people to protect and defend our export controls. The policies the government make need to be rigorously enforced and we're trying to increase the enforcement capacity because we just don't have enough enforcement agents to do a great job. coming into R2. Let me uh 59893 you about the National Weather Service. Um Kentucky has been the target of floods and hurricane tornadoes and everything. This guy's quiet as [ __ ] In fact, they we lost 20 people two weeks ago in my hometown and adjoining area. Um, I'm concerned about the implications of uh local weather forecast offices operating at reduced staffing levels. Take for example the Jackson, Kentucky office, which is currently operating with multiple vacancies and no permanent meteor. No word from Trump yet. What can we do about uh about that? ECB officials expect rate cuts to be paused at the July meeting to ensure Noah's local weather forecast offices that is positive for the US technology and staffing to issue timely accurate warning. If they're going to stop uh if they're going to if they're going to pause rates that implies the US may be cutting. Well, that's how it'll be taken. Collection technology is in full force in effect. Our satellites, our balloons, all sources are in full force and effect. The National Weather Service employs 2100 meteorologists. Less than 130 took early retirement. Uh it is fake news and inappropriate to suggest a single meteorologist or hydraologist was fired. That is preposterous and silly. Less than 5% chose to retire. And we using these responsible commerce department sought and were were granted ability to hire those uh people the same number. So we will have no no reduction in force. Our national hurricane center has full staff. And I want you to understand just the last portion what you said. We have numerous regional offices which are generally small and you know they usually have three or four meteorologists. And these exist because the data is locally hardwired into old computers with hard drives and green screens. If I showed it to you, you would be embarrassed. The idea is to automate that, to put it on the cloud so that the 2100 meteorologists we have and the hundreds of hydraologists that we have can forecast the weather from central locations and back up each other and be more appropriate. So I think the technological advancements we will make over the next year or two years will totally change these things. But I want to be crystal clear. Every single person, the National Weather Service, we are at full staff. We have full capacity and we will have the best forecasting capacity that we possibly can to protect Americans. And I will not sleep if that were not true. that is required of you, of me, and of America that we deliver that for American people, and I promise you we are. Mang. Thank you, Mr. Chair. Um, I'm I'm glad to hear the status update of the regional local uh weather offices. Uh it's very your testimony and the numbers are really different from what's been reported in the press. We just want to make sure you know whether it's New York, my home state, or states like Kentucky, which have uh gone through such horrible circumstances and our condolences to your constituents and their families. Mr. Chair, um we want to make sure that uh our local communities can be prepared. Um would I know that you're saying it's inconsistent from the reporting. Would you or your team be able to provide statistics and just more uh accounting of what has happened where there are uh retired or layoffs just so we can all be on the same page if you do think it's inconsistent with the press reporting. Sure. There were no layoffs. As I said, there were less than 5% retirements and we have the authority to replace them, but that turnover is historically lower than it has normally been. As you can imagine, people are entitled to retire who've worked at the uh the department, but I'd be glad to give you very specific details. Um be my pleasure. Okay. Thank you so much. Uh I wanted to switch gears and ask about the Census Bureau. In April, uh, NPR reported that the hiring freeze and recent Census Bureau staff departures, including those of five division or office chiefs are raising concerns about whether the Census Bureau can continue producing reliable statistics for this country. Acting Director Ron Garman also recently noted that the bureau lost more than a Just a note here that Trump is anticipated to come into the or to have a presser in the next accessing hourish of America. Uh he's not normally on time, so they gave him 11:30 to 12:30. Mr. Secretary, uh what are you doing to address these concerns? Again, my capacity to communicate uh throughout this administration has made the Department of Commerce uh well situated. We are not losing staff in ways that we don't want to under any circumstances. we are able to fulfill all of our mission at uh the Census Bureau. The Census Bureau is one of the great statistical places in our government. Our capacity to analyze and statistically think things through. If you couple that in its full the Bureau of Economic Analysis, right, where we where we live and we do GDP, that is a great center of statistical capacity. And I think so we have sought to add to the commerce department the bureau of labor statistics so that CPI I mean shouldn't we have all of the great statisticians in the government working together again these are the same concepts which is use technology use automation I mean the idea that the Bureau of Labor Statistics has enumerators calling around and asking for data when technology makes that amazingly capable and we could do so much better. So, we are seeking to use technology, but I can promise you the census is both well staffed and more importantly brilliantly covered by statistitians who are great at doing their job and I am really excited for the structure of how the census will work going forward. But you won't hear anything about weakness in accuracy. I'm not saying the fake news doesn't like to just say these things, but it's just not true. and I'll happily send you those statistics as well because uh you'll be very comfortable with the Department of Commerce. Thank you. And just to follow that uh follow up with that um recently you uh terminated the three advisory committees. Uh there are also scheduled only two major field tests in 2026. Can you provide us an update on the field tests? When are they scheduled? uh and uh what are the changes to the questions about race and ethnicity uh and also talk about the advisory committees. The advisory committees was were set up uh again many of these things were set up long ago and they've sort of run their course and we didn't really understand what type of advisory committee we need to understand how to do a census. It didn't seem logical. Uh with respect to the questionnaire, we have not considered that as of yet. So I don't we just not have we have not spent the time thinking about those topics. Uh the dennial census is quite far away and we have plenty of time to think about that uh going forward. Thank you. I yield back. Judge Carter. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Mr. Secretary. Uh my district in central Texas has become a leader in semiconductor production thanks to strong partnerships between the state local uh political organizations, the industry, the universities, and the workforce training centers, including programs tailored for veterans and military families. How is the dep the department supporting these types of locally driven efforts? What more new high to accelerate the pipeline of skilled American workers entering the semiconductor industry next target 59926 of the Trump administ now chasing the pre-market high asked to uh be part of the team to build that. So if the trillions of dollars that the Trump administration is bringing into inve if you are if you're a seller of 6,000 calls you may want to roll production facilities to reshore manufacturing. We need to train great Americans to be uh you know we say HVAC technicians. You realize these factories have have these really high-tech closed loop cooling systems. Amazing. But training our workforce to do this uh is really a key part of the administration. I think we'll train 5 million Americans for these great jobs that are coming just like that semiconductor plant in Arizona. I mean 3,000 jobs for each plant and they're building 10 of them. So, these are just great jobs coming and Texas, I know, is going to have a great uh participation in that and both you use the schools and I think it will be uh an extraordinary outcome for Americans. Well, Samsung is being a good neighbor in my district and I'm real proud of what they're doing. Um, as a member of the defense appropriation subcommittee, I remain deeply concerned about the national security risk tied to our reliance on foreign made semiconductor components. What step is the department taking to reduce our dependence on overseas manufacturing, particularly for chips that support critical defense systems. Taiwan produces 90% of the world's wafers which the world's wafers the world's chips. So it's for everybody including China has demand for 10 million sort of high-end wafers and we uh with the increase of a hundred billion dollar investment that the Trump administration was able to bring in uh from TSMC uh we will get to about 12% production woefully inefficient and I think what you're going to see is the Trump administration is going to be very very focused on bringing chip production to America and the full supply chain to America. That's going to bring in probably between 500 billion and a trillion dollar investment. And you're going to see that across the United States of America. And and the Trump administration is very very focused on trying to get up to$5 million wafers during this administration, which will be a record-breaking speed. But I think it's very important for exactly uh the topic you raised. That's that's fantastic. Uh I'm encouraged uh we are encouraged by the launch of the United States Investment Accelerator and appreciate your continued focus on revitalizing American manufacturing. Can you share more about how the roll out of this new office will take shape and are there other or any other any early projects we can expect particularly those that support the development of critical defense related semiconductor technology. It has been too slow the process to build a great factory and a great advanced manufacturing facility in America. Generally has taken three plus years from start to finish. Dude, I'm telling you what, [ __ ] Bitcoin might be the best deal right now. If you want something that's lagging where we're going, Bitcoin There looks Look like this is over. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Um, good morning, Mr. Secretary. No, it's back on. I um wanted to join quickly with the comments from the chairman, the ranking member regarding Noah. And I hear your point about fake news and numbers, but I'll say this. I mean, I have two no installations in my district and headquarters is I don't know, just a couple miles across the line. And I heard a very different story than what you're saying about people being forced out of there. But I look forward to getting the answers that you provide here. I also saw um your comments with respect to uh Senator Van H. on yesterday. I look forward to to seeing your responses to his questions, too. Wanted to ask you about MBDA, uh, which the ranking member raised as well during your confirmation hearing on January 29th before the Senate Commerce Committee, uh, Senator Blunt Rochester asked, \"Yes, do you support dismantling the MBDA?\" And you said, \"I do not.\" Now, I got this the skinny budget numbers here. Um, and it's got EDA and MBDA combined uh with a cut for 624 million. Um, and in the narrative connected with that, it says that um MBDA the agency is fully eliminated. So, I want to ask you what changed and what's the status of MBDA at this point? uh MBDA is not being fully eliminated. That's inaccurate. We are reducing it to its statutory minimum size as as is appropriate. The problem I well Bitcoin is so I've got a brief I'm writing in the background here right now. Let me mute this for a minute. I mean so I'm writing a brief in the background right now. Last night I made a post. So, so yesterday after the close, I started doing some research and I'm like looking at the market yesterday, like last night, early last night, late last night. I I actually did a bunch of [ __ ] from like uh I don't know if it was like I might have done it from like 4 until 900 p.m. Then I woke back up in the middle of the night and did some more [ __ ] And I made a post on Twitter and I was like, \"This [ __ ] market's about to goddamn squeeze like in a big way.\" [Music] Uh, now this morning, um, some data started coming out saying the same confirming the same thing this morning. And uh so I'm writing a brief right now about this uh concept that I have. And um there's more agreements today uh with that statement that I made. So, like yesterday I couldn't read it or I the early day or the end of the show I got done with the show and I'm like I'm like like I can't tell if we're gonna like uh roll down or squeeze and so I'm like looking at all these different [ __ ] like this divided by that and this that divided by this and um watching like financials and um semis and transpose and um uh advanced decliners, uh, breath, a bunch of different [ __ ] right? And, um, this doesn't mean we can't pull back. Uh, I think I put that in the post, too, in the on Twitter. You can go find it. I'll put I'll I'll I'll uh I'll pin it right now. Hold on. Pin it so you can see it if you want to read it. Um,"
