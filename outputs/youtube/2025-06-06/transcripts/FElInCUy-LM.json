  "title": "Canadian Banks Q2 Earnings Review",
  "transcript": "All right. So Trump comes in, brings on tums and tariffs, pretty much chaotic on the stock market. And then Canadian banks have to navigate through this uncertainty. They have to give out loans, look at their provision for credit losses, and we are now at Q2 reporting their earnings. And let me tell you, we are on for some surprises. So, who would have thought that TD Bank would actually surge up by 26% year to date? So, this one is doing incredibly well. Most of the other banks, you know, they're pretty much stuck in that. I'm not too sure what's going to happen. Most of them underperformed TSX since the beginning of the year, but not by a wide margin. What is not surprising though is since the beginning of the year, Scotia Bank is still lagging. But speaking of Scotchia Bank, we are in for another surprise. After pausing their dividend in 2024, they came back with a good, I would say, yeah, a good dividend increase of 3.8% for this quarter, and it was not the only bank that increased their payout. Actually, went for 2.5, National Bank for 3.5, Royal Bank at four, and then Scotia Bank. When you look at the payout ratio for this quarter, you can still see that Scotia Bankang is still not in trouble, but definitely behind all the other big five at 72%. We have at 62. So, those two are not I mean, yes, they've been generous. They are showing like the highest yield right now, but the payout ratio is also a little bit high. I prefer to go for the one that are close to 50% around like Royal Bank for example, National Bank. And another surprise for me, and we're going to talk a little bit more about CIBC in a second, but CIBC had an amazing quarter. If you look at the adjusted earnings per share for Q2, it's up 17%. And numbers are pretty much all over the place. We have like National Bank and CIBC like the up double digit, but we have like a few not really good performance. I mean TD is down 3%, Scotia Banks down 4%, pretty much stable at one. So as you can see even though there are all Canadian banks operating in an igopoly their business model is different from one another and their performance is also different from one another and you can really appreciate the difference from one bank to another by looking at their business segment. So let's start with the personal and commercial. Alo PNC as you can see here we have like strong performance such as like Royal Bank that is up 14% for its personal business up only 3% on the commercial one while on the other side we have BIMO at minus 10 and Scotia Bank at minus 31 what really hurt this quarter is again banks are making more volume so they're increasing their loan book they're generating more revenue but the provision for credit losses keeps on increasing it was the same story for all of those, but that hurts the net income. If we move now on to the US or international markets, well, we have that is flat at 1%. The national bank actually did pretty well with ABA Bank in Cambodia and also KY in Atlanta. We have TD Bank of course that got hammered because they are in the middle of a restructuring activity for their banking activities. Actually, they sold their stake in Shaw Schwabs that boosted their earnings. they will benefit from that money to actually do more of that US banking restructuring activities. But in the meantime, it was expected that hurt, but that's all right. I mean, a lot of their profit, a lot of their money right now is going towards building a more solid banking approach in the US, dealing with regulators over there because now they are being followed because they have to play nice so they can eventually have the asset cap lift up in the US. right now it's not on the table so they will have to do a lot of work there. CIBC up 15% which is pretty good but most of it actually was because last year they had higher PCLs on their US activities than anybody else and I explained you a few times already when those loans actually are getting back on track they recover from that PCL and of course now that the provision for credit losses is gone the earnings goes back up. So Scotia Bankang kind of like surprising usually it's the opposite. They're doing well in Canada and not so great in on international markets but this time the PCL were not that great were not that bad and the revenue increase so they were up 7%. In terms of wealth management and this is where you can see that the diversification pays off a lot. All banks were up double digit and it was all the same explanation. The market is going up. They are charging fee on the assets under management and of course those fees are increasing naturally. So everyone had a great quarter for the wealth management. Now moving on to capital markets as you know this one is about investment banking global investment. So sometimes it's great sometimes it's bad. And you can see I mean down 6% for Beimo up 56% for National Bank. That's kind of crazy right? Up 1% for TD down five for Royal Bank. So it's a little bit all over the place. We also have the insurance business at Royal Bank that did well at 19%. The two biggest stories I found in this quarter was one national bank's acquisition of Canadian Western Bank. So now that has been put in the book that boosted the revenue but also boosted the provision for credit losses. So that's why we see the PNC only up at 2% is mostly because they got more than $200 million in provision for credit losses thanks to K and Western Bank. I still believe it's an amazing move for them because it will open the doors to more expansion across Canada and on top of that they will benefit from their link with the commercial activities that they had Western to offer them wealth management services because Canada Western Bank did not have this segment in their activities. The second story was actually TDI getting out of the mud and trying to reassure the market. So, as you can see here, it's not a matter of like the the numbers, but a lot more about the narrative. They took actions. They decided to sell their stakes in Charles Swabs using that money to actually do the restructuring properly. It gives them more flexibility, more liquidity. So, it is going towards the right direction. Now, it's just a bet on the narrative at this point, but I'm fairly confident that TD knows what it's doing. So, what's the best deal among Canadian banks right now based on their valuation? So, if you look at the P forward ratio, we can see that Scotia Bank is still the cheapest bank to buy, but I mean, they're still not showing that much growth, so I would probably not go there. TD Bank actually is pretty decent. But one that caught my attention because it's been about 12 months now that they're reporting very solid quarter after quarter. CIBC. I was quite surprised. They're doing well in Canada. They're doing well in the US and their wealth management and capital markets are also doing well. So what's going to come up next? I don't know. But I was kind of surprised, happily surprised to see CIBC, a bank that I did not like much for the past 10 years actually trying to figure out a way to bring some growth. Of course, you have National Bank and Royal Bank among the most expensive one. But keep in mind, they are the one showing the strongest dividend triangle. They are the one showing the highest dividend growth rate and the lowest payout ratio. There is a price to pay for quality and I'm happily paying it for Raw Bank and National Bank. Now, enough talking about the big guys. Let's take a look at the small guys. EQ Bank, Go Easy, and another surprise. Propel Holdings. I decided to add Propel just because it's a very small fintech company using AI to underwrite loans. They're doing great, but keep in mind super highly volatile. All right, so for the three of those, as you can see on the graph, they're not generating that much return for shareholders at this point. And this is one of the reason why is because they are less diversified than the big guys. So EQBank flat revenue earnings per share down 17%. Why? Well, you guessed it probably. PCL's provision for credit losses increased by 36%. Net impairment loans increased by 8.6%. In other words, yes, they're doing a lot of volume. They're acquiring a lot of clients, but they're also seeing their loan book looking a little bit worse than it was before. They still came with a dividend increase of 4%. They are increasing their dividend quarterly now. So, they're like doubledigit dividend grower over the past few years, but at this stage, it's not going to be sustainable if the company continues to show higher provision for credit loss. So, you have to be a bit more careful with this one. Go easy. Now revenue up 10% but earnings per share down 8%. So what happened over there when you have like 10% revenue increase and earnings per share down 8%. Well the thing is the earnings were hurt by lower yield across their portfolio. So now they're offering lower yield of course because of federal laws but also because interest rates have declined. The interest in financing those loans also increased. So more expenses, lower quality of yield and there you go, you have like earnings per share that is going down. Good news though, the charge off rate was at 8.9% which means that there are on target. The last quarter is that was 9.1%. So they already expect that anything between 8 to 10% of their loans if they are going bad, it's just normal and there will remain profitable. It's part of their their business model as they offer loans to people that sometimes will have a higher rate of default. Now for Propel, this one is kind of crazy. Revenue up 44%, adjusted earnings per share up 30%. So crazy numbers usually coming for small cap. They came with a dividend increase of 10% and the provision group for grid losses also increased double digits. So we're up 39%. So while you can see that there's a lot of revenue, there's a lot of earnings, you have to be careful about that. Those three companies could look really good on prom night, which means that when the economy is booming, when consumers can't pay their debt, this is the type of banks that is going to do amazing. On the other side, it's also very possible that they have a very rough time during a recession. So I would just put that as a side note. Just please do your due diligence and make sure you don't jump on those right away. Another thing is a lot of investors are tempted to compare a company like EQ Bank with a market cap between three and four billion dollars with Ry Bank which has a market cap well above a hundred billion. So please take a moment here to consider that you cannot really compare those two. It's like comparing like a pee hockey players at the age of like 13 with Conor McDavid. I mean let that little kid a little bit of time to see how he is going to develop. So what we have learned this quarter? Well, revenues are increasing because people are getting more loans and it is boosting all banks revenues. The thing is provision for credit losses continue to increase as well. So right now we are in a game that as long as we increase our revenues, we increase our earnings enough that not all the benefits are being offset by the provision for credit losses. But still it increased double digit every single quarter starts to concern me a little bit. Diversification wins over everything. If as you can see the big guys did well with wealth management and capital markets while the smaller guys well they're stuck with saving in loans and that's also why they have not been able to pull out strong numbers. Good acquisitions that has been made on the table. So HSBC boosted revenues and earnings for raw bank. We have Kin Western Bank for National Bank as well. CIBC has been doing well with their previous acquisition on the US and now we have like TD doing the other side around selling some assets to kind of like restructure this entire business. So the future is looking a little bit better. So all right guys, that's enough for this bank earnings review. If you have any questions, I'm going to see you in the comment.
