  "transcript": "Investors and traders, welcome to the channel. Market shot pattern. Today is 5th of June 2025. Hope everyone is having a fantastic day. Uh so we'll take a look at the key markets in this video. Uh we'll start by taking a look at the Tesla stock because it is in the news. I do not need to get into the details of um the news. You can actually Google about um Elon Musk Tesla something like that and you'll get to know everything. So we just uh try to focus on the technicals here u nothing else on the channel. As always this video is for educational purposes only and it's not a financial advice. Uh just one request um if you guys would like to support the channel uh then the donation link is in the description I will really appreciate that as I need to um get a better hardware to be able to keep on producing the uh videos. Um, as you have seen, um, I've not been able to produce many videos over the past week and this week in particular. Um, so let's start by taking a look at the really long-term chart of Tesla. And you can see that um, this is of course after the split. It has gone through several splits right here. It was a big split here and another split here. So the price by trading view has been adjusted for it. Um, we can draw a nice um, upward trend line here. And we have seen this stock actually rally and decline um a lot. So for example, this decline was uh right to the 78.6% retracement. So that is by how much it retraced nearly 80%. Uh one other stock that I've seen uh do that for different reasons is actually Meta. Um it actually also declined to right to the 78.6% 6% retracement um of the IPO lows uh to the all-time highs when um Zuckerberg pivoted towards Meta uh being a metaverse um company and um it wasn't really clear to investors how much the company will be willing to spend how to monetize there were many unknowns and when in 2022 he began to pivot into artificial intelligence is where um the investors uh understood um because the company had a lot of data and they have made a quite a lot of contributions to artificial intelligence and we saw saw the stock recover and make a new all-time highs. So I've seen stocks uh make new all-time highs after making um really deep retracement and Tesla has also been one of those stocks. Um but it does have a pretty big decline. So this decline is uh you know about 50%. Um but it's got an ability to actually um make uh find support and make new all-time highs. So where we are right now um Tesla of course you can see that that was our target for $500. um while the stock was trading somewhere around here. This is when we had projected this and actually um some people also um made comments uh negative comments um on that video but um you know we were to be proven right. Uh it took a while but you know these are monthly charts it take a long time. Um and then we didn't exactly hit the um $500 uh level, but it came to $488. Spot 54 is close enough. Um you know, such a expensive stock, especially if you look at it pre-split. Um it's really expensive. I think it's like 400 4,5005,000 stock. um you know in pre-split value declined another um 50 56% right here after that after completing the pattern and it had a really nice month of May it was up 22.79% and June has just started and the stock is down already 17 nearly 18%. Um so that's a pretty big decline. So what is likely to happen uh with the price action uh or the price levels that we should be watching? So, one of the things is that the really key support is around here around 200 um roughly 220 to 210 is really really key support level and I'm going to show you that uh on the um daily charts and the weekly charts as well. Um and of course this 1936 1.8% retracement going all the way back to uh 2019 when the stock had made a kilo right here. Uh it's just got um these levels really really um super support levels especially this low because we are counting it as point C for an ABCD higher and if that gets taken down to the downside then the pattern is changing ABCD to the downside uh which could see the stock you know being somewhere around 100 bucks. Um, so far, you know, a little bit early. Uh, but, uh, if we begin to go and take a look at this on the, uh, weekly charts, we can see that the week is not over yet. We've got Friday trading to left. Just this week alone, um, the stock is down -7.83%. Uh, that's the biggest decline. I mean, this one was minus uh, 3.48% was just nothing in comparison. Um and this decline was -3.83. Uh right here -3.27 uh - 10% um here 12 13%. Um and then of course there was no follow through and then it just uh continued to move higher 8% uh 5.5%. Um, this one was 7.59%. If we just go right here, going back to 2021, 15.4%. Uh, I don't know why it's showing me 2.2%. Um, so you can see what I'm trying to say. This one has been the biggest uh decline that we have seen. And the week is not over yet. So, we have to give it benefit of the doubt. But the important thing is this stock has had these kind of declines in the past as well and it has recovered after completing its key cycles. So right here point C is really really important around 212. Uh now let's go back to the daily chart. This is where we were really really watching it very very carefully uh when it was found uh forming this bottom pattern right here. So this is really important because this is point C of our potential ABCD that we're watching to the upside. If it goes um the as a support level then the stock u you know obviously is going to target lower price. But right here today where the stock has closed is uh it touched right into the 61.8% retracement of these lows to these highs uh which could be potential support. But with this kind of wide ranging bar the stock being down minus4.26% 26% which I don't think we have seen in this entire like lower it was - 8.28% right here um another big one we can take a look 3% right here it was uh -4.68 68 U 8.39. This is the biggest one right here. But it's also potential potentially it could be support, but I would have really like to see an ABCD pattern. So with this kind of um uh negative price action, um I wouldn't be surprised if the price moves a little bit lower as well and then if we begin to see some sort of consolidation take place, that would be quite nice. But uh again um this is uh really really unusual uh for this market to be down um nearly 15% in one day. So really wide ranging bars. Um there could be more selling behind it. But right now where it kind of touched is a um support with with this kind of um wide ranging bar. So much negative uh uh selling pressure on it. Um you know whether it's going to hold or not we remains to be seen. For us the key support is around this level where I have the box. So we are watching this really really carefully. Okay. So I'm going to switch over to the indices now. So uh before that let's take a look at uh what the debt markets are doing because it's really uh important. Let's take a look at how the 10-year uh did the 10-year had a um uh spike up in its yield but it's still moving below our key resistance level that we are watching here right here. Um, and especially because it's broken below the 20-day moving average, the chances are it's actually moving lower and uh if we have a pattern which could actually see the price um go as low as 3.7% on the 10ear yield. Getting above this level uh getting above um you know um 4.65 uh% you know that changes everything. This analysis to the downside the yields moving lower uh will be negated. But um what we're watching is the pattern and the possibility exists for the yields to actually move lower. Um and if we take a look at the long uh bond yields um it's got a nice uh pattern formation right here. Pretty strong resistance coming from 5.15%. And we have seen the market actually move lower. We also have this one to one price projection APC. So confluence of number of three things coming together. So pretty strong resistance. So, we could see a leg lower. Um, and the chances are uh we have got non-form payrolls coming out tomorrow. So, let's see how that goes. But the yields are below the 20-day moving average, which is short-term traders watch. So, the momentum is turning to the downside. So, which is actually uh what the pattern is suggesting lower yields. Getting above 5.115% uh negates this analysis. Let's see how the dollar did. Um so the dollar is kind of hanging in there. Um it is uh you know finding support between 99 98 level which is really really crucial for our dollar getting below on consecutive closing basis below 98. I think uh we could be looking at what we are watching on the weekly chart right here. Uh so we could be looking at this ABCD around 95 uh 9450 level uh for dollar. And uh by the way I've also have a substack where I am actually posting more regularly because I I can write things. Um and then in here I also share things which I'm not able to uh easily share on the uh videos because of the time constraints. Um so for example how the different world indices performed. Um you'll see the notes right here and of course if you subscribe it's free. You just have to go to uh market chartpattern.substack.com substack.com. The link is in the description and just subscribe um to the newsletter. It's free uh at least for now and then you'll be able to receive in the email format. You can read it um you know while you are um maybe in a train or um you know um when you have your in your own time. Uh so I cover a lot of these things. I think these were the kind of patterns that we were watching and I also share um their individual stocks that kind of uh outperform and the S&P 500 on daily, week to date and monthto date and year-to- date basis and the stocks making uh 52- week highs. Not just the S&P 500 stocks, but also Footsie 100 250 and German DAX stocks as well. um if there are any uh really moving to uh new 52 weeks highs, my system actually picks those up and I like to share them here. Um so I encourage you to actually also subscribe to the Substack if you want to. Uh now let's take a look at how the gold uh did. Here we go. So the gold was under a bit of a pressure but the key uh is for us 3117. So as long as that is held we have got a bullish bias but also look how much time it is spending near this top here. So we have to be careful of that. So if you begin to see um you know wide ranging bar something like this we could see uh the price move lower. Essentially it's moved into the top of the range um it really needs to break out of this to move higher but the support remains right from the 61.8% retracement. Now S&P S&P 500. So we have a key timing coming in over the weekend essentially. So basically um as of close of business uh tomorrow which is Friday uh the timing um is kind of started already but uh the essentially it's 8th between 8th and 9th of um June when we have key timings. Um and what we are seeing is this is something which we were expecting a pullback. Um this is what I discussed in the substack as well. Um so today we have had the market close nearly about half a percentage point to the downside. We have got non-farm payroll coming out tomorrow. However, it remains above this key level right here. Still got a chance to uh move higher. But even if there is a pullback um we have we are watching for this 38 38.2% retracement. So 5650 5640 is going to be a key support level. So that is equal to the you know what we like to discuss the market symmetry concept here. This is how much the previous pullback was in this uh uh move higher. So it could we could have a similar move. So we'll be watching this but we are expecting some sort of a pullback uh to happen in the market. Uh it might have already started from uh today but we've got some key economic data coming out with regards to jobs tomorrow. So tomorrow will be really key. And then if we take a look at the NASDAQ cash uh here we go. Um we were really uh expecting or watching really for the market to get high as high as 21989. So far the high has come in around 21891. So we have missed it by about 100 points um or in a you know index which is trading at 21,500. So we just missed it by by not not a lot. It could still hit hit that um but right here. so close to these stop right here um we could see some sort of a pullback happen in this market. Ultimately what we're looking for in the S&P 500 and NASDAQ 100 as long as this April uh 7 lows are held um we are actually expecting the prices to move higher and we could target these higher levels right here. Uh but the key is 7th of April uh low being intact. Um getting below this will of course change a lot of things. key really support uh in time and price which came uh in NASDAQ 100 S&P 500 indices um you know that will be broken and it'll be a major major thing to happen uh but we have seen a very nice recovery almost making new all-time highs um and the chances are we will see actually the bullish move to the upside. So we are actually watching for that but a pullback uh could be imminent actually. So this is what we are watching uh bit of a shorter video because of time constraint um and just wanted to put out uh for you guys just uh before I leave let's also take a look at some of the key stocks uh technology stocks meta I wanted to discuss uh meta you can see we were discussing our uh ABCD pattern one price projection double bottom really nice rally and uh it's kind of cleared this uh resistance level this was our targets. It's met our target but the market is strong. Um although it closed negative for the day nearly half a percent. Uh but this is where I think we can go into some sort of consolidation. Ultimately I think we are going to pro we are likely to make new all-time highs and I have further targets as long as 7th of April lows are held 800 to 900 bucks uh per share for Meta. um you know it's achievable as long as 7th of April lows are held um and on the monthly chart is really long-term um I have um one to one price projection could even take us to about 1,100 bucks per share so you know this is meta is really really strong uh another one is Zcaler so the zcaler look very very strong um this is something which we had been watching on the weekly chart and zcaler you know you If you long-term subscribers will know, we spent a lot of time right here. This is where this market was really choppy and we had this scenario that we discussed. We are probably in this ABCD higher as long as this point C is held. It was tested twice and look at this really negative 21% decline in one week. There was just no follow through. Um there was in strong hands and look is doing really nicely. It's getting very close to our target. So this is the power of the patterns. we just have to um believe in them and uh you know with respect to having uh our risk managed where we have the point C point D etc. Now um another one is Roblox. Here we go. So Robblocks um getting very very close to our target of 100 bucks. Um we went through a lot of consolidation right here. If anyone is familiar with VOF work, it was the Vikov spring. So accumulation, accumulation, accumulation and then um it really uh moved out of it, pulled back. Um let me actually go down to the daily chart. Here we go. So this is where we had actually mapped out when I mapped out. I've got the videos in the archive. Um I thought okay when was doing this pullback after achieving our $63 target which is 38.2% retracement. I thought uh if we could do an ABCD and maybe a complex uh correction like this. Uh it will be really nice. This is exactly what it it did. I mean this is something I had drawn before uh just out of um an idea or my imagination. This is how a complex correction could actually unfold. and I did not know that the stock will exactly do that. So, this is mapped in in in advance um weeks and months in advance and so nice to see really really strong stock. It's kind of under the radar. It's not being talked about a lot. Uh but guys, Robblocks because regards to metaverse, there's a lot of strength into it. A lot of strength. Okay. Um so, this is what we are watching in the key uh technology stocks and uh the major indices. A bit of a shorter video for you guys. Just uh one request again if you want to support the channel the donation link is in the um description it will just help me with um with workrelated uh matters getting better hardware subscription etc. I really really appreciate that and if you want to also subscribe to the substack you'll get emails it's free in your inbox and I also cover a few more things there which I'm not easily able to cover in the videos which is time consuming so thank you very much good luck good trading and speak to you guys doing."
