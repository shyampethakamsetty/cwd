  "transcript": "You're listening to The Moose and the Loose, your 10 minutes action-packed financial podcast with your host Mikey. Hey, what's up market moose? Mike from the Moose on the Loose. I hope you're doing well on this Thursday. Um, today let's go on the positive side. Let's go on talking about what do you do when you finally made a good pick? you didn't make any mistake. You did your due diligence. You bought a stock that is now up 100% and more. That's kind of crazy, right? Um, you know, when I started investing several years ago, I thought those 100, 300, 500% return, a,000% return were were things of the past. I thought, \"Oh, I wish I was part of those guys who were able to buy Johnson Johnson uh in the 50s or in the 60s, and now they're showing those amazing returns.\" And then you see those like classic Coca-Cola charts of like if you invested like a hundred bucks like 70 years ago, today you would be a millionaire or something like that. And then I'm thinking, well, okay, that's not the reality. I started investing 22 years ago, so in 2003. And I thought all right so let's try to be more focused on just making like I don't know like 8 10% returns and that will be more than enough and and that's going to be it right it's impossible now to show those 100% returns and ironically over the years I had many and when I say many I said like probably like close to 20 holdings that at one point or another was up by more than 100% my portfolio. So the question is um well first how do you get there? Well you get there in a very simple way. It's kind of like counterintuitive but you just get there by buying a good stock and sticking with it. Like like the number one mistake investors make is whenever they buy a winner, they have a winner in their portfolio. um there's kind of like this psychological mark maybe at like 50% or even 100% and they're just like, \"Okay, that's too good to be true. Let's get rid of it. Let's move on and cash my profit.\" Um that is probably because you're investing from a place of fear. You're investing in a place where you believe that the market is about to crash every single week. And and you shouldn't. You shouldn't. And yes, you're going to say, \"But Mike, nobody ever uh lost money by taking profit.\" I'm like, \"Yeah, fair enough. But what if that profit could have turned into 100, 200, 400% return instead of like 50 or 75 just because you were scared to see what was going to come up next. So the first thing to remember is when you have a winner and the number keeps on validating your investment thesis. I mean there are reasons why you selected these stocks in the first place, right? So when you do your due diligence, you have within your investment thesis. So you know why you have this company in your portfolio. And when this company is doing exactly what you thought it would be doing by showing you numbers, by showing you growth, well, then it's more reason to keep it, right? Not to get rid of it. And and and that's that's the secret to reach more than 100%. And once you are at 100% return, there is no indication it's going to stop. Actually when I look at some of my holdings uh I have like Apple that is up more than a,000% in my portfolio. I have Microsoft that is up uh I think it was like it's like 400 or 500% return. Visa is more than 200% return as well. And and the reason why I still have those uh stocks in my portfolio is every quarter I look at the numbers. I don't look at the total return. Actually it's kind of funny. I had to go back to my account to see what was the total return on those companies um before recording because I don't track that. That's irrelevant. What's relevant is what do I think of this company? So, what's my investment thesis? And are those are the numbers are the financial metrics, the financial statements telling me exactly the same thing. If they are aligned, there's no reason for me to let go of this company even if it doubled or tripled in value. I mean, I it just means that I made a good choice. And God knows, you need those winners in your portfolio to have a good average because not all your stock picks are going to end up like this. I mean, I don't know about you, but that's that's my story. Uh, not all of them are like home runs. I do have like some great stocks. I have okay stocks and I have like poor performing companies like anybody else. But the fact that I hold on to my winners for decades now, well, that makes the whole difference in my investment portfolio return. Now, once it's at 100, the only thing that I will look at is not the 100% return, but rather the weight of my portfolio. So, you know, um I'm tracking my uh pension plan live on dividend guy blog. So, you can head there. Every month I do the full report, full position, you know, every of my trade, you can track it down. I started this back in 2017 and I haven't stopped since then. So in that portfolio, what is great is I cannot add capital. So I started with 100 grand, now it's close to 300 and I could not add a dollar. So it's only dividend being reinvested, profit from the stocks and that's it. Now on the US part when I invested in 2017 most of those investment doubled in value and I sold some of them but I did not sell them because uh I wanted to make profit. Um so here's a few example. Um yeah I I sold uh Texas Instrument at the end of 2024. And the reason why I sold my shares of Texas Instrument even though I was way above 100% return is actually because the dividend triangle was slowing down. So I saw that revenue and earnings were slowing down. It has been a while. It was like more than two years. And yes, I can I can usually I'm patient and I can deal with that. But the problem I had with Texas Instrument is at the same time the stock price kept on rising. So, I sold above 200 bucks a share for that reason. There was like such a discrepancy between what the the company was doing versus the numbers and the stock price. And I thought, yeah, well, let's cash that profit because it's it's not working the right way. I have no problem um keeping my shares of Costco, for example, even though it's highly overpriced at 1,000 bucks a share. Well, I bought it at like 500 500 bucks something. And at 500 it was already highly overpriced. So I don't know. But what I do know is the revenue keeps on growing, the earnings keeps on growing, the dividend follows, and the company has a playbook to grow even further. And as long as it's going to be able to grow at this space, I'm going to hold on to my shares because it doesn't matter if I'm 100% up or not. The investment thesis is there. The numbers are backing the thesis. So I'm holding. Another one that I sold though is Black Rockck and I still really like this company. My investment thesis is still intact. Uh largest asset manager in the world, largest ETF manufacturer, strong bond with institutional investors. They offer all kind of products. The diversification is amazing. They have Alladen, a platform that is helping um institutional investor to manage risk. So they're providing more service. They generate fees on assets under management. It's kind of like a nearly perfect business. And I had to let it go. I had to let it go because even though my investment piece is amazing and I still believe in it, the numbers for the dividend increases were not there. Over the past three years, I think the uh the dividend increase was like two or 3% per year. I am like that that doesn't fit with my strategy and that's the reason why I sold. So yes, I was up more than 100%. That was fine. But the problem was it's not aligned with my strategy. I focus on strong dividend growers. I mean, when I look at my DSR Pro dashboard where I put all my portfolio together, the average 5 years of all my my stocks combined is 9.13. I mean 9% annualized dividend growth rate over the past 5 years. That's what I have in my portfolio. So I know that my um dividend will double uh almost every seven years which is kind of crazy and it tells me that the business that I hold are driving because you cannot afford to increase your dividend high single digit like this for several years without being in very good shape. So going back to the original question um don't look at your returns look at the investment thesis and the quarterly earnings and then after a few years if the company does not deliver in terms of numbers well then it's time to let go. Sometimes you're going to let go making good profit. Sometimes you're going to let go not making profit at all and taking a loss. But the point is to stick very close to your investment strategy. And to do that, you need the numbers and the thesis that works hand in hand. If they don't, well, there you go. You got your reason to sell and then you move on. In the meantime, if you let your winners win kind of like forever, unless they become too big in your portfolio, well, then you will have a portfolio packed with winners that are actually going to continue producing. It's like I mean, we're right now in the middle of like the hockey playoffs, right? It's the final. Um, after McDavid scores two goals, are you gonna bench him saying, \"Oh, yeah, he's probably tired, so we're not gonna try to have a third one.\" No, you're gonna let him play. You're gonna let him play because you know that he's consistent and as long as he's showing the same level of productivity on the ice and he's making the right plays, you want this guy on the ice as long as possible and as often as possible. Well, this is the same thing with your winners. Keep them and your portfolio is only going to be stronger. Sorry, Moose. That's enough for today.
