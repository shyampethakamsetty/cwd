  "transcript": "Welcome to the rap. I'm Sam Bartis here to take you through today's market action. A day that started with progress in US and China trade talks, ending with a Tesla induced sell-off. The Nasdaq took the biggest hit, down 8/10en of a percent. The S&P slid a percent while the Dow shed a quarter%. The Russell slipped just under the flatline. All sectors except communications closed lower as well. Consumer discretionary was down 2 and a half%. Consumer staples lost more than 1%. Taking a closer look into Tesla, the company lost about $150 billion in market cap after CEO Elon Musk declared, \"Without me, Trump would have lost the election.\" He made a series of ex posts urging Americans to oppose the president's big, beautiful bill, calling it a threat to the US economy. Trump said he's disappointed by Musk's opposition to the tax bill. Tesla slipped back below its 200day simple moving average and is still 30% lower so far in 2025. Palanteer, another company tightly tied to the administration, fell almost 8% today. Brown Foreman closed as the biggest lagard in the S&P 500, the Jack Daniels parent company saw $894 million in revenue slip well below Wall Street estimates of $990 million. Brown Foreman sees continued tariff tied headwinds in fiscal 2026, but the CEO says the company is well positioned to navigate uncertainties. Shares of Brown Foreman hit their lowest points since 2013. Visa hit all-time highs though today after Mazuo upgraded the stock to outperform from neutral and raised its price target to 435 bucks from $368. The firm sees Visa capitalizing on more consumers using credit cards for spending, leaving room for another decade of solid topline growth in the US. Visa is up more than 15% year to date. After hours broadcom trading volatile after posting a fractional earnings beat, the AI giant posted 20% year-over-year revenue growth, but current quarter guidance of $15.8 8 billion is about in line with Wall Street's estimates. The CEO expecting AI semiconductor revenue to accelerate on robust demand for AI networking. No big earnings on the docket tomorrow, but there is important data prints to watch for at 8:30 Eastern. The highly anticipated May jobs report will give us the latest non-farm payrolls and unemployment rate data. That'll do it for the wrap today. I'm Sam Bartis.
