  "transcript": "What's up guys? It's Ray J back with another video. And in this one, I want to break down what's happening with the overall market. I'm going to talk about why the market is selling off quite a bit, what's going to likely happen tomorrow if we see this trend continue.

Anyways, let's talk about the market. So, the market's been pretty crazy as you guys could tell. We've saw this like really big selloff recently. We started off with this very, very nice pump because of some news about President Trump meeting up with Xi Jinping and having a good relationship and a good meeting. Um, and then what happened was we got lots of bad news from Elon Musk and President Trump and the whole market collapsed. We saw this selloff and if we continue to lose support, we may continue to see more downside risk. So, I'll break down the levels for you guys in just a couple of minutes. But let's first talk about this. President Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the phone today amidst the tensions that were rising. The good news is that President Trump talked about how they talked about the intricacies of their recently made and agreed to trade deal. He mentioned that there could be a trade deal coming very soon and they have a great relationship. President Xi invited him and Melania to China and then they did the same thing back. They invited, you know, him to the White House and they had a great phone call at least so far. So that was good news. Uh, as soon as President Trump started to talk about this, um, the market was bouncing in the beginning. As you can see right here, we were seeing this nice rebound move and then as time went on, the market started dipping and dipping and then it just dumped. What led the market down was Tesla. Tesla's down 14%. It did come down. It tried to bounce a bit to 322 and then it just collapsed after some big news came out involving Elon Musk. So, not the best of news came out. I want to go over that real quick. Then I'll talk about the charts in a lot more detail. So, what started all of this was Elon Musk saying that he's sorry, he just can't stand it anymore. This massive, outrageous, pork fililled congressional spending bill is an absolutely disgusting abomination. That's essentially what he said. Shame on those who voted for it. You know, you did wrong. You know it. So, he was criticizing President Trump's spending bill. Okay, that's huge news. And obviously, you know, President Trump was not really happy about this. Going up over here, you know, President Trump was just criticizing Elon Musk in a lot of different ways. He also said that he would have won Pennsylvania regardless of Elon, and he's very disappointed with Elon. He knew this bill better than anyone, and he only developed a problem when he found out I would cut the EV mandate. So, that's what he said so far. He also accused Elon Musk of having or developing a type of TDS, which is Trump derangement syndrome. and he's saying that some embrace it and some become hostile. So, he is criticizing Elon. Um, but then Elon Musk ended up saying in another tweet that he basically did not know about the specific details about the bill and he found out like more recently because a lot of things changed. And then Musk said that without me, President Trump would have lost the election. The Democrats would control the House and Republicans would be 51 to 41 in the Senate. He also called President Trump ungrateful in another tweet. So, you know, they're they went from being good friends to enemies. You guys can see that they're just they have different views. They're just not happy with with one another. And we're continuing to see these arguments escalate and they got really bad as time went on. So, we're going to actually talk about how this got worse. Musk Musk also said that President Trump is lying about him because, you know, uh Musk said that that about President Trump. President Trump said that Elon was wearing thin. I asked him to leave. I took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy EVs that nobody else wanted and that caused him to go crazy basically is what President Trump claims. Musk is calling him a liar. So then President Trump said this. He said, \"You know what, Elon? You want to see us save money on our budgets? Billions and billions of dollars will be saved if they terminate Elon Musk's governmental subsidies and contracts.\" I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it. So now, President Trump was on the offensive, trying to criticize Elon Musk, trying to terminate his subsidies and contracts. As soon as President Trump said this, we saw Tesla dump even harder. Big dump from Tesla as a result and just continuing to crash as a result. It's down 14%. You know, so much for getting a massive like run approaching the robo taxi event. We could still run approaching it, but as of right now, we're not ready. We're not ready for the bounce yet with all this crazy news. Um, and then on top of this, there's even more bad news that came out from Elon. I'm going to talk about that in just a second. So, Elon is now saying that look, you should keep the EV/s solar incentives cut in the bill. Also, cut all the crazy spending increases in the ugly the big ugly bill so that America doesn't go bankrupt. So, now Musk is saying that he's just not happy about what, you know, President Trump is saying. He also claims that Trump is lying because he's okay with the incentives being cut. He did actually say that last year that he's okay with it because he thinks it's going to be hurting their competition more. Now, I beg to differ because I do think it's going to hurt Tesla at least for the shorter term. They could offset the risk with the robo tax and such, but that's pretty much it. For more news, I just wanted to say that um with what's going on, uh President Trump said the same thing, right? He he said that the easiest way to save money is to eliminate Musk's governmental subsidies. Then Elon Musk also responded again by saying that in the light of pres the president's statement about c the cancellation of my government contracts, SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately. So now his companies are taking action against everything. And then we have this right here. Um we saw I think the co-creator of Dogecoin say that can I finally say that Trump's tariffs are just super stupid? Musk respondents said that the Trump tariffs will cause a recession in the second half of this year. So, not the best of news, man. This is very negative news. Now, Musk is just against President Trump entirely. Um, you know, things really, really shifted. We're talking about governmental subsidies being cut. Um, Musk is now saying there's going to be a recession coming. The list goes on. It's absolute madness. And the stock market did not like this at all. It followed Tesla eventually because Tesla was down 14%. So, with that being said, what else does this mean for the markets? Honestly, it's not the best of news. We also have some data coming out tomorrow being Friday, June 6th at 8:30 a.m. We have the labor force participation rates. We have the unemployment rate and non-farm payrolls. All this data may cause some volatility, so be ready for this just to be safe. And on top of this, we have Broadcom announcing earnings. Um, you know, they did relatively well when it comes to their guidance and such. They beat expectations and guidance. Um, but the share price didn't run too hard. Despite having good guidance and such, we're still doing well, but I don't I don't think this is that significant anymore compared to what we're seeing involving Musk. So, what's going on here? Okay, you know, Tesla dumped really, really hard. I do think Tesla's going to try a small bounce, try to retest like 290 to 294 and then we'll see if it rejects again because when you zoom out and go to like the daily, we still look very weak. So even if we kind of like gap up, we could still come down lower if we get more bad news. And we have to see if we could hold around that 270 area. If we can't hold this, we could be dipping lower. Don't forget there's more gaps to fill. So is Tesla about to collapse and start filling these gaps. If 270 fills us, I do expect more downside. So be careful. I do think we could kind of pop in the morning, maybe gap up and then we may still fall lower because we're still very weak. We're getting lots of high volume selling and a lot of fear right now. So, please um you know, keep that in mind. That's some big news. Um that's going to be very key for how we end up moving and overall there's a lot of weakness on Tesla stock. Um so, I do anticipate this move to continue. By the way, we're just not looking too good. When it comes to SPY, we're looking kind of weak on the daily. Now this is dependent on can we get back above 598 and bounce or do we just continue to fill at this level. So we have this support at 595 previous resistance becoming support where my cursor is right and we ended up losing this level. So if we can't hold above 595 like I said earlier we're looking more bearish. Could we retest it? We might kind of push to retest it. But if we can't hold 595 I do expect 588 than 585 to be tested. There is going to be a risk of more downside looking at the current setup. It also depends on the unemployment numbers that come out tomorrow morning. But for now, the setup is looking weaker. Now, if you want to be a bull, you need to see us get back above 598. I'd like to see us reclaim that to continue. As of right now, we got a big rejection. Notice that SPY hit 595, it rejected, bounced. It hit 598, rejected, bounced. We hit 599, and instead of holding above 598, we rejected again. So, that's another sign we might be continuing to fall. So, we're getting a higher volume selling. And what may happen is that tomorrow we might see a small push to like 595. If we can't hold above this, we could continue to fall for 588 or below. And there could be another big downside move coming. Also, if we can't hold 585, there's that gap to fill all the way down to 579. That could also drag us lower. So, there might be a temporary pullback move. We have to get back above 598 to be bullish. If not, we're going to be watching 595. Can we reclaim that? We might touch it tomorrow for a small rebound, but then if we reject again, we're going to likely continue to fall for 588 close to the 50 EMA, then 585 as we look a bit more bearish in my personal opinion. So that's what I'm seeing so far for SPY. Also, um SPY also happens to have a double bearish divergence on the MACD and the RSI. So, we're getting higher volume selling and a large bearish divergence, which is not looking too great. For the QQQ, we're also making higher lows so far, but we're also forming a triple bearish divergence. Let me just double check this. So, I think on uh the MACD, it's looking like that. It's more of a double bearish divergence, actually. So, we have a double bearish divergence, which typically suggests more downsides coming now. So, as we went higher, instead of seeing our indicators remain bullish, they ended up flipping a bit, and that's a sign we might end up seeing a pivot. So, what am I watching for? First off, can we get back above 528 to 530? If we reclaim that, yes, we could be bullish. If we're bearish, you want to see us fill at this big blue trend line. So, see this blue trend line? That's our support. If we can't hold around there where we currently are, and we lose 523, I expect the QQQ to continue to fall all the way down towards 520, if not 517. So, for the time being, I'm anticipating some downside. I think the odds are favoring uh you know more downwards pressure for like 520 to 517. So please keep that in mind off this double bearish divergence. This isn't a triple. I mean it doesn't really matter guys. At the end of the day it's a bearish divergence. We also have a bearish divergence between I think NQ and ES which is not the best of signs. So tomorrow we could try a rebound move. We might try to retest like 526 or so. But we have to hold above 528 to 530 to remain bullish. If we can't do that and if we lose this blue trend line, there's going to be a risk of us dumping towards like 517 or below for another downside move. And in case we lose 515 to 517, we also have this gap to fill down here. So, you want to be very careful for the IWM. Okay, we have something very similar going on. This had kind of like a cup and handle like structure. It's also holding up for now, but we need to see this hold above 210 to continue to push. If we end up losing 207, we're looking for a dip back down. So, please keep that in mind. We're in the middle. We're kind of flat right here. So, it depends on which way we break. If the whole market starts dipping, that could also drag the IWM down. If we lose 207, we're looking for a dip to 206 or below. And if we break 210, we're looking for a bounce. We're going to likely consolidate like this. Uh, so be ready for some consolidation before we potentially see some downside if we end up getting a break. So, please keep that in mind. For ES, we're looking weak. We're in the middle here. We're at 5950. So, can we hold 5950 and get back above 5980 to bounce? We need to get back above like 6,000 to really push higher. If we can't do that, our range is between 5950 and 6,000 like this. And if we hold below 5950, I think we could be dumping towards like uh you know the low 5900 area. So, there's going to be a risk of us coming down lower. I think we push a little higher tomorrow towards like 5960 or so near the 20 EMA for a small push. we may consol it and we have to see if we can get back above 6,000 to be bullish. If we can't do that, we might consol it and start dipping again. So, just be very very careful. In my technical video yesterday, I was talking about how the market may see some consolidation in the dip looking at our our setups and that did end up playing out. Um it's just that the catalyst was a very uh different one. It was a little bit unusual. Um for NQ, we have a double bearish divergence. Actually, sorry, it's a triple bearish diver divergence. excuse me, a triple bearish divergence. Um, I'm seeing it on the RSI and MACD right now. Um, that's going to be suggesting downside unless we get back above like 21,700. We're actually favoring a rejection and a move down to 21,400 if not back down to 21,000 flat for some downside as a very very probable possibility on Bitcoin. We're making lower highs here. We got this rejection off the blue trend line. We had to hold this to bounce because we lost this. The support right over here is at 101, uh, 250. If we fail there, we're looking for 100,000 FL. If we bounce here, we could be looking for a rebound. So, there's going to be a good chance of us potentially rejecting. Also, another problem with Bitcoin is that we have a head and shoulders now. So, there is this left shoulder, head, and right shoulder. If we don't hold 101,000, we're looking for a dump towards 97,000 next. So, it looks a bit more bearish for Tesla. Like I said before, we're a little bit weak. It did end up going lower than expected, but we could see an attempt to get back up towards um the 294 area. We might see a small bounce for the low 290s and then it could just be a lower high. If we can't hold above 300, we could critic we could reject and see a dip with this criticism that we're getting and there could be another retest of these lows. We're not ready to see a big bounce yet unless we hold above 300. If we get back above 300, I'm looking for 310. But if we can hold 300, we might bounce towards like the 290s before it rejects again. We could be turning right back down. So that's what's likely happening at least thus far. Um when it comes to um Nvidia, I think we're looking a little bit weaker because of this. We got a rejection so far. The PO is negative. And then on top of this, there's this gap down here. So, you know, if we could hold above 140, we're looking for attempt to push to 144 or above. If we reject here, we could be dipping back down to fill this gap and retest this trend line around 137. We'll see if we bounce or not. If we lose that, we could be dumping more and we'll have to see how things end up going, at least for the time being. For Apple, we're rejecting off the daily time frame. Um, we're going to be watching this 200 area to see if this holds. If that fills us, we could be dipping back down to 197. If this rejects, we could be looking for a bigger move down. So, watch 200 and see if it holds. If not, we're looking for 197. So, give this some time. For Netflix, we're bullish. We're looking for basically 1250 to 1280 is our targets. We could be going a bit higher for 1280. So, we'll give that some time. MSTR rejected here. We're looking for 362. If that fills us, we could be dipping to fill this gap towards 350. So, overall, um, we could be rejecting and making lower highs. So, give this the time it needs. For others out there, we also happen to have Celsius. Celsius is once again trying to push higher, but be careful as we hit this 41 area. It's going to be a tough resistance. Hold above 41, we're bullish. If we can't do that, we could be looking for a move back down to 39. On others out there, such as Super Micro, we're looking kind of weak here. We're making lower highs. We need to hold 40.48. If we don't do that, we're going to be at risk of dipping to 38.5 for some downside. Palanteer has a bearish divergence. We need to hold above 123. If not, we're favoring a dip towards this um 50 EMA at 112. So, we might be dipping a bit more on Palenteer. Rivian's kind of weak here. Of course, the EVs are reacting similarly. We want to see if 13.8 holds. If not, we could be dipping more all the way down towards 13.5 or below to 13.1. So, I pumped and reject. We're going to see if we hold 13.3. If not, we could be dipping lower. AMD is rejecting here near 120. We're going to see if we hold above that to push higher. If not, we could be dipping to like 111. ARM is also forming a head and shoulders. We're going to see if we could hold above our support or not. If we break 132, we're looking for a bigger push. If not, we could be dipping back down towards 126. For PayPal, we have a double top here. We're going to see if we hold above 72.5. If not, we could be dipping back down to 70.76. Coinbase needs to try to hold 244. If we don't hold this, I'm worried about this big gap over here. So, if 244 fails on Coinbase, um we could be dipping to um 240, then eventually 232. If 232 does not hold, we could be dumping to fill this gap, guys. So, be very careful on Coinbase. There's a left shoulder, head and right shoulder here. Is this about to dump? So, you want to be very careful in case it does dip. For Amazon, we're looking weak here. We could be dipping to 202. Meta's rejecting here. We need to hold above 690 to remain bullish. If we can't do that, it could revisit 675 and we'll see if it bounces there. So, I do think it could pull back just a bit. Google's decent. It is barely holding 169. If it doesn't hold, we're looking for 168.01. 01. We'll see if it bounces off there. Microsoft is bullish looking for 470 as a potential target. So, it's doing a good job at holding up with all this talk. DJT dumped as well with all this criticism. There's a head and shoulders may continue to fall back down towards the 18. So, be careful. The VIX is starting to push, but we need to see if this could hold above our I think it's the 4 hour or 30 minutes. Uh, we want to see if we could hold above 19. That's going to be where the 50 EMA is. If it does, we could be pushing more. The 10ear is going to be looking for 4.42 and the dollar index is kind of flat here. So, we need to give that some time just to see how things end up going. Anyways, as far as the stock market is going, we're still looking weak now. This is like a potential pivot that could be coming. Looking at our signals, unless SPY could reclaim like 598s to bounce, we're now starting to favor downside with these bearish divergences. Uh they take time to develop and today is when we finally got confirmation of them. And then with Tesla dumping, I don't think we're done yet. We could try to gap up tomorrow. I do think it's going to gap up, but we could still reject if we can't hold above 300. If we come short of 300, if we hit like 294 and reject, we could continue to retest the lows. It depends on what we hear from the two big guys, Elon Musk and President Trump. What do these guys talk about this time? They do not like each other anymore. They're just fighting like crazy. And then you know all this stuff that's getting dragged into this from the you know EV mandate to what's happening with Elon Musk's incentives and etc. You know it's all affecting Tesla big time. When Tesla makes a big move we end up seeing that affecting the markets and simultaneously you know all this fear is kind of like coming in and it's just not really helping the way which things are going. Musk also said some things about President Trump that are like really really serious. I can't really show them on my channel. It's just he made some claims about him which are just crazy. Um Musk is saying a recession's coming in the second half of this year. Like it's all this bad news. The market does not like this so far. So this could just be the start of some bad news. Will we get another negative catalyst? It depends. Get ready for the big data tomorrow. We have the unemployment rate. We'll see what that looks like. Hopefully we're we're at 4.2% or bel below. Um if it starts going up, that could be another negative catalyst for the stock market. So make sure you guys are ready just to be safe. Anyways, I thank you all so much for listening."
