  "transcript": "[Music] Hello and welcome to this weekly market recap for the week ending Wednesday, June 4th, 2025. I'm Tom Bolley, chief market strategist at earningsbeats.com. It's a pleasure to be back with all of you again this week as we take a look at what has happened over the course of last week. Just a reminder, uh, when I'm looking at a weekly recap, I'm looking from last Wednesday's close through this Wednesday's close. So, a little bit unorthodox when we're talking about weekly, uh, recaps. Usually, it's the calendar week, but this is going from last Wednesday's close to this Wednesday's close. So, keep that in mind. Uh, today we got a uh, report out from the um, uh, well, the jobs market, ADP employment report. was out this morning, two days ahead of when we're going to see the uh non-farm payrolls, but the ADP employment report showed a pretty solid decline in jobs. Uh the expectation was 110,000. We came in at 37,000. So much much lower than expected. The uh April jobs number was um uh revised just a little bit lower from I believe it was 62,000 jobs to 60,000 jobs. Uh so not a very good report. um been talking a lot about all the possibilities with inflation and um uh stagflation and tariffs and all of this. Um meanwhile, I think the data, if we just focus on the data, continues to point to the fact that really I think it's the economy that the Fed should be focusing on right now. So, um you know, I think that's kind of been the theme of late. I think the market is saying one thing that we should be seeing lower rates. The Fed is saying another that says, \"Hey, we got time. The economy's been okay. We're not really worried. Let's give it some time. Let's check out the data.\" And in the meantime, I think what we see is by delaying uh our rate cuts here in the US while Europe continues to cut rates, uh I think that's starting to play a role here in some of these economic reports that are coming out not so great. So anyway, that's uh one thing that that's really kind of on my plate that I'm thinking about daytoday. And it's going to be very interesting to see what the Fed does later this month in its uh next Fed meeting because uh you know the odds have been all along that the Fed was going to cut again in June. I'm not so sure what's going to happen. Um and with the Fed just about anything goes. So I'm going to sit back kind of watch maybe get my popcorn ready. Uh taking a look at the action from last week, the NASDAQ performed uh the best, gaining almost 2%, actually almost 1.9%. Small caps 1.43% gain. S&P 1.4. Dow Jones up a little more than 3/4 of 1%. S&P 400 midcap up almost 7/10en of 1% and transports lagging gaining almost uh 0.2%. But across the board, you can see we did have gains again over the last week. This momentum in the market continues to build. We had a a top recently on some of the ind indices and some of the sectors where we have struggled to get through but other areas like the NASDAQ continued to power forward. So I I think what's happening here is money is still rotating in more aggressive fashion. Uh especially again with NASDAQ leading last week. I think that kind of underscores that uh belief of mine and um all the many of the sustainability ratios that I like to follow continue to support movement to the upside. So I think the more likely path going forward is going to be higher in the market. But I have a couple other charts I want to show you today. We'll get to those in just a minute. Let's take a look at the sectors first. So over the course of the last week, materials, that's kind of a strange group that led this past week. We haven't really heard a lot about uh the materials, but technology is second in among that group or among these 11 uh sectors. And you can see next comes in the S&P 500. So, we've only had two groups in the last week outperform the S&P 500. And of course, one of those technology is weighted about 30% in the S&P 500. So when we get really good leadership from technology that makes it more difficult for other areas to outperform um anytime technology leads that's why when the market is really doing well and we have areas like the aggressive sectors technology consumer discretionary communication services when they lead a lot of times they're the only three sectors that lead everything else takes a back seat because if you look at technology discretionary and communication services. They make up uh roughly 50% of the S&P 500. So, if those three are leading the S&P 500, it just stands to reason that the other 50% probably is lagging. We can't get every sector to lead the S&P 500 simultaneously. That's not possible. So, other areas suffer when technology is doing well. Um but technology doing well is generally a good thing for the stock market. We like to see that. All right. I wanted to point out the seasonality because if we go back just for one second, look at the bottom of this list. Consumer discretionary is at the bottom uh of the 11 groups, but it has the strongest and most bullish seasonality throughout this secular bull market during the month of June. So, I wanted to show you that on the seasonality chart. So, here's the XLY. And if you look at it, look at the XLY during the months of May, June, and July. If you zero in and take a look down here at the bottom, May, June, and July, if you add those three together, that comes up to be 7%. Meaning that the XLY, consumer discretionary, has averaged going up 7% per year over the last 13 years during the months of May, June, and July. May's been a strong month for consumer discretionary. June historically is a strong month and July is really a strong month throughout this secular bull market. So history is lined up for discretionary to move higher. That's why I kind of chuckled because over the course of last week, of course, starting June, we've got discretionary underperforming and in the the 11th spot out of 11 sectors. Anyway, we'll see if that turns around. But last week, obviously, uh traders were not paying attention to history. 10-year Treasury yield. You know what amazes me here is that whenever we get any kind of reports that talk about inflation or that there's possibility of inflation or the tariffs whatever bond you know the yields on the 10-year Treasury yield tend to go higher and we see like these big headlines that the market um you know the stock market is going to struggle ahead or maybe if the market is pulling back the reason for it are is the fact that the 10-year Treasury yield's moving Where's everybody been over the last uh week and a half? Because Treasury yields been going down. Why don't we have headlines talking about the fact that headlines are going down? And that could mean that a lot of bond market participants don't believe at all that we have an inflation problem. Don't believe at all that tariffs are a problem. Because when the when the yields are coming down, that's essentially the message I'm being sent when I look at the charts and I try to understand the story in the market. that it doesn't line up with the headlines that we're seeing in the media. So, I'm still believing that we are going to get rate cuts uh throughout the balance of this year. I don't know how many. I think we will get more rate cuts and I think stock market's going to be at an all-time high. Um 10-year Treasury yield is also kind of agreeing with me. We're not really seeing any kind of breakaway to the upside in these in these yields. Now, one thing that I would maybe look at for hints about what the market might, you know, when the Fed might cut is, you know, our first cut last year when we had that uh 50 basis point cut in the Fed funds rate. Remember that was back at the I think it was September 17th, 18th meeting or 16th, 17th, whatever the dates were. Look at the one month Treasury yield dropping in the three or four weeks leading up, maybe three weeks leading up to that Fed announcement. You could kind of see that a lot of folks were anticipating that rate cut. And so the one month dropped. Then we kind of bounced and then leading up to the November 6th, 7th Fed meeting, look at what the one-mon Treasury yield did again. Went back down again. again anticipating that cut. Once again, we had a little bit of a bump and then the three weeks leading into the mid December Fed meeting, once again, it was priced in with the one-mon Treasury. The reason I'm bringing this up is right now I'm not seeing any of that. So, the the one-mon treasuries are not reflecting uh a potential cut coming up in June. Um, I would think if we were going to get a cut and if you start to think that we might or you want to just maybe look for confirmation, I would expect to see this one month US Treasury yield drop. And you can track this at stock charts using the dollar sign US, United States Treasury 1 M for month. Dollar sign US1M. Put that in there as a regular, you know, have that as a regular chart that you look up from time to time and just kind of monitor. Now, we have kind of pulled back a little bit off the high we saw in miday. And now, you know, we've probably come down about maybe five basis points uh over the last couple weeks, but that's nothing like what we've seen before. And if we're going to get a cut, I would think that this is going to start to happen pretty soon. Um, and here was the Fed funds. So, you can see the Fed funds took this drop in September, October, and November. And we've pretty much been flat this year. Obviously, that's what you know, we haven't had any rate cuts, no rate hikes. And so the Fed funds rate's been pretty flat, but again that one-year or the one-mon Treasury may give us some hints there. So let's to take a look at what the charts look like right now on the major indices. S&P 500, if you look at it, still in this nice uptrend, bouncing off the rising 20-day moving average, going up, taking out the highs we saw in midMay. So we are putting in slightly higher highs. We have a negative divergence on the PPO, but unless we have some sort of a big reversing candle, this could be eliminated. I mean, if price action keeps going up, we could see this PO turn higher and take out the high that we saw in midMay. So, just because you see a negative divergence when you first break out, you need more evidence uh other than just the possibility of slowing momentum on the PO. We want to see something else that suggests that the market's topping. maybe a couple of other things that suggest the market stop topping. Right now, we're not seeing that. So, be careful about uh predicting that too soon. You know, you don't want to jump the gun, start, you know, getting really defensive or selling off everything and then watching the market continue to move higher. NASDAQ 100, same exact situation. Here's what I was talking about earlier. We continue to push to new highs above the highs we saw back in miday. And with that, we do have a negative divergence. But watch, maybe a big bearish engulfing candle, something like that, uh, might signal a short-term top is at hand and maybe that negative divergence would play out a little bit longer. That's something to kind of watch. Keep in mind, IWM, small caps. This one we haven't broken out yet above the miday high. That's what I'm kind of watching for. Looks like a bottoming head and shoulder pattern here. Uh, left shoulder, neckline, head, neckline, right shoulder. And now we're back up threatening if we make the breakout. This measurement would be an all-time high. So again, another chart in my opinion that's telling us to really keep an eye on it because a lot of folks think, \"Oh, we've made this big run. We can't go any higher.\" Uh I think yes, we can. I think we could go right back to all-time highs and start setting new highs as we go into u you know, further into the summer months. Midcaps, uh underperforming small caps, still not quite back up to the high we saw in midMay. And then transports, uh, if you just kind of watch the slope of the downtrends and all, you'd see transports clearly the weakest of the bunch, but still holding on to support around that 14,500 level, and I'd keep watching that. So, you know, there's one thing that's just just jumping off the charts at me, telling me we're going higher. And I could have pulled it up on all of those major index charts, but I didn't um because I've shown it before. and instead I'm going to show it on the sector charts this time. And what I'm talking about are the AD lines, accumulation distribution. So look at the XLK. This is technology. So yes, we're going higher. Yes, we're trending above the 20-day. Yes, the 20s rising and trending above the 50, which is also rising. But AD lines have been soaring off that April low. And that's what I want to focus on as we go through these charts. XLY discretionary ad line soaring. How about uh communication services ad line soaring. How about uh the industrials ad line soaring about financials? Financials kind of weakened recently soaring to new highs. Now let's move over to the defensive groups. Are we seeing accumulation in all areas of the market or is it just in the aggressive areas? Um, well, if you look at this, here's health care. Uh, we just broke out to a multimonth, certainly a 2025 high on the AD line. Not as strong as maybe some of the other sectors, but still, uh, moving higher. How about Staples? Staples. I mean, we've just been kind of going across here flat. Look at the AD line accumulation in uh, the Staples. How about real estate accumulation? We haven't broken out to a 52- week high, but we have set a new 2025 high. And then uh the last one I want to show you is utilities. Utilities broke out in terms of price action, also AD line. So outside of energy and materials, I mean these are the nine areas. Five aggressive, four defensive, they're all showing major accumulation. I would dare anyone to find a period in time where we were just topping and the AD lines were just off the charts in all areas of the market, all the major indices, all the key sectors, most of the industry groups. I see a lot of money supporting this move in the market to the upside, which is why I think we keep going higher. Um, if you like what you see here, um, you can go go over to our home at earningsbeats.com. Uh, we do have a no cost trial, 30 days, no cost. You do have to pro provide your credit card. Um, but we'll let you know at the end of your trial period that, you know, um, your trial period's ending and offer you a great annual price to cut down the the price quite a bit or you will be, you know, you'd move over into a monthly category and pay monthly. Um, but we will bring it up. We're going to talk to you about, we want to make sure that you are comfortable as a member of Earnings Beats. But if you want to just check out our free Earnings Beats newsletter, that's EarningsBeats Digest. All it takes is a name, email address, no credit card. So if you go over to earningsbeats.com and scroll down, you can get this EB digest comes out Mondays and Wednesdays. And an interesting part of this, by the way, is that over the last two days, this week, Monday and Wednesday, we provided our newest chart list, which is leading stocks chart list. This is a chart list that keeps a lot of the stocks that are the m high momentum stocks that are carrying this market right now to the upside. We're updating it every week. And for now, if you are a earnings beats digest subscriber, we will provide you at least for now the um leading stocks chart list that we do every week. Um and you can have that at your disposal to use and to review. And uh I think they're some of the best stocks to trade. I've been trading off this list now for the last couple weeks. Had excellent results. And if you look at it, I'm going to show you um this was this week's list and the first stock on it's just in alphabetical order, but the first week on it is a lot limited ALLT. Now, if you're like me, there's probably a lot of stocks or some stocks on this list that you're probably not going to be very familiar with because we're looking across the entire, you know, landscape of stocks that are out there, thousands and thousands and thousands of stocks, and we're narrowing it down. in this case to 43 stocks. 43 of the best stocks out there right now. And Alt is one of those. This stock since the April 7th low has doubled. It's doubled in two months. So, you know, even a lot of the bigger stocks that have done well can't make that claim. They can't make the claim that they've doubled. But look at the AD line. AD line continues to sore. Price action's been great. We are getting close to key overhead resistance. So, I wouldn't be surprised maybe to see some sellers coming in pretty soon, but these are the types of stocks that ordinarily I wouldn't be drawn to. Now, here is the leading stocks in leading industries chart list that we did last week and I believe during the show last week, I gave the same offer. We're doing it all again. We're going to run it back again next week. So, if you missed that, make sure you go back over to earningsbeats and sign up right there. Uh, go to our homepage, earningsbeats.com. Name, email address, all it takes. Um, the other chart list, the one we sent out this week, you can see Laser was the best has been the best performing stock today or was the best performing stock today. This is just an intraday. Look at these stocks. Um, or I said Night Inc. I think that's Nite Inc. anyway. Um, LSR leading stock today up five and 3/4%. Apploven 4.5%. That's probably a stock many of you are familiar with. Spotify up four and a half%. I mean, these are the kinds of stocks that are coming up here. All the one I talked about earlier, up almost 3%. OLO up 3%. So, anyway, make sure you check that out and sign up for our EB digest. If you do on Monday morning, we are going to provide the latest list of leading stocks and leading industries just like these last two. We'll have a new fresh list for next week and we'll send it to you on Monday morning. Anyhow, that's basically what I had for you today. I really appreciate everybody tuning in. Um, we'll be back next week to do it all again. Take a look and see what's going on with these leading stocks and also of course take a look at the market. We do have a big jobs report coming up on Friday. I want to make sure everyone's aware of that. non-farm payrolls. If that's a low number, like this morning's ADP report, I think you're going to start to see more and more and more pressure on the Fed to think about cutting rates again. So, watch that one month US uh Treasury yield uh as well to see if it gives us any hints of such a cut that uh could be coming. Anyhow, appreciate you tuning in.
