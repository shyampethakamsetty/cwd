  "transcript": "Welcome back. It's time for under 30. Taking a look at Applied Digital, we're joined by George Tillis, senior markets correspondent for the Schwab Network. George, this is a really interesting company. It's in the kind of Nvidia partner network, which is a an important thing if you want to be within AI. But they're now, you know, announced this leasing agreement with Qawi for their what is it, Ellendale, North Dakota facility. I guess the best I could put it seems like a pretty big deal. It is for applied digital, because this is a large deal compared to the size of the company. And I think that's why if you look at the last, you know, month, the stock has risen by about 150%. And essentially this company is, you know, a high performance cloud computing business. It's AI based software company. It's basically does things like host crypto mining establishments, language processing, graphics rendering and essentially machine learning. And, you know, core. We've also which is backed by Nvidia, is in the business of essentially providing this AI as a service in in other words, they're renting and leasing hyperscale to hyperscalers. These these back end servers and high computing networks. And I think the combination now of applied as well as Corey, we believe is more compelling for applied digital because the $7 billion, 15 year projected deal with core, we've essentially basically looks at, you know, more than tripling the top line sales from last year, which around $220 million. And the other thing is, is this deal is also very large in terms of the ratios of the market cap of Applied Digital, which, you know, as of the closed yesterday, is around two, $2.3 billion. So this deal essentially, you know, more than doubles if not almost triples their effective market capitalization relative to sales. And I think that's why we're seeing such a such a massive run up in the stock. So, George, then my question for you is probably a bit impossible to answer, but we're going to try. Then why did we see this this rally completely fail? I mean, the actual markets have firmed up. I mean, just over the course of the last 53 minutes or so. But this rally, I mean, I read the press release and I was thinking hugely positive also for core, we've but then none of that strength has held throughout the session. Well, so it's a good question. There's a lot of things going on. You know, first off, you know, looking at the larger picture, you know, companies like Tesla actually are down significantly. So that might be a drag on some of the AI company names like Core Web which is also down, by the way, double digits. And I think that's why we're seeing a spillover effect in Applied Digital. Now. It traded higher earlier today and now it's coming off. But you know I just look at some of the some of the practical, you know, ways of approaching stocks. Just looking at the last two days or three days, the stock was trading less than $8 just a few days ago. It's now traded over $14 in the premarket. And I think even during the regular session. So it's quite extended. And you know, when you see parabolic moves just straight up in three days, you can you can expect two things. Obviously you can expect a continuation, which is possible. But you could also expect a meaningful pullback to perhaps about 50% of that explosive move in the past three days. So maybe that's this is what we're seeing. The other thing is I noticed that Corwin, which also disclosed a 5.5% stake in Applied Digital, is down quite a bit. And that might be based because Nvidia, which is nbis. If you look at that stock, that's a core we've competitor in Europe. I noticed that stock was higher by 20% today. So that might be sort of a competitive share shift from core. We've spillover from Applied Digital into New or New York group. If I'm pronouncing it correctly. Nbis. And that might, you know, come back to these names, core weave and apply digital as, as the traders sort of reverse and look to capitalize on convergence and price action. I know to George, one of the things when I talked to the company's CEO, they were excited about with Allendale in particular, one relatively small community but welcoming of their presence, land not an issue and access to power not an issue. So if this is successful with core, we've you can kind of reasonably see how the expansion would be there relatively easy over time to that area. George"
