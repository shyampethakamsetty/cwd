  "transcript": "Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Keeping Up with Trump and Musk. On today's episode, the fallout. Trump threatens to cancel Tesla's EV subsidies. Tesla stock falls 14%. Elon, as a result, is now decommissioning the Dragon space capsule. Trump just set back the US space program by a decade. Rocket Labs is ripping in the after hours on this news. And apparently the Epstein files is not being released because Trump is implicated of a Maraago party shows Trump giving Epstein his personal attention. The footage shot in November of 1992 before Trump opened the resort as a club shows the future president surrounded by cheerleaders for the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins. capturing Trump's fun-loving bachelor lifestyle for an appearance on Faith Daniels NBC talk show. We're going to get great ratings in your show. Trump is surrounded by women as music blares in the background. After a while, Trump goes to greet three new guests. Among them, the financier Jeffrey Epste. More than a decade before his guilty plea on state prostitution charges. Later in the footage, Trump is seen talking to Epstein and another man as women are dancing in front of him. Trump alternates between dancing and pointing out women to Epstein and the other men and telling Epstein about the cameras. Though exactly what they say is difficult to understand. As they discuss the women and their appearances, Trump gestures to one and appears to say to Epstein, \"Look at her back there. She's hot. And then Trump says something else into Epstein's ear that makes him double over with laughter. But as the president said, Elon, Trump, just call each other. And we're also going to talk about stocks and stuff. So stay tuned. Welcome everybody to the Daily Recap Show where we talk about stocks and the financial markets. My name is Chase. If you like this video, please subscribe, hit that notification bell as well as the like button, and leave a comment for the algorithm. Let's get into it. This is the daily heat map of the S&P 500 and US stocks fell on Thursday as escalating tensions between President Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk overshadowed a phone conversation between Trump and China's Xihinping which had lifted investor optimism that a strained US China relationship could be thoring. And on the back of everything we saw today, it was actually a very very mixed day. Look, there definitely were winners, but it was largely overshadowed by some of the losers. You can see some of the bigger names here, Visa, JP Morgan, Berkshire in the financial space really took it on the chin. Walmart, Costco in the retail trade space along with Home Depot were very, very red. Tesla was down 14.2% on the day. Exon Mobile in for Energy, United Healthier when it comes to health services. Nvidia, Apple, AVGO, most of semiconductors and hardware very very red. Software was kind of green except for Meta which was down 48 of a percent and and Google which was slightly up. Software was actually largely Brazilian except for Meta which was down half a percentage point and really it was just the big names in each of the sectors really taking it on the chin, really falling. the broad market kind of mixed and that led the S&P 500 to be down because when the market movers fall the S&P 500 is going to follow suit falling 0.55 of a percentage point but if there wasn't even a rotation today gold fell.5% and if you look here Staples was at the bottom of the heap we had healthcare at the top of the heap so there was no real leadership there wasn't a defensive rotation there wasn't a safe haven rotation to me it was just typical market momentum and the market just reacting to all of the news events and circumstances that happened on the day and that is why we had uh the day we had today with about half the sectors gaining the other half falling and you know the S&P 500 falling in aggregate mostly because you know the technology sector falling.3% as well as the XLY the discretionary space because of Tesla falling 14% in a single day and that was the story of the day large cap growth really took it on the chin small cap growth was the only green factor and size segment and everything else was in between very red on the day. Some sectors did outperform. For example, midcap growth. You could see it's it's in red here, but it really should be in gray, virtually flat for the day. But call in value in aggregate very red. And you know, if you were just indexed the market today, you're probably waking up, you know, anywhere with your portfolio down 4.3. And we actually did get fairly positive trade news from the market today. I mean, Donald Trump, I'm going to read a tweet here I put out. Trump just told us what he talked about with G. And I thought it was bullish, guys. They have a date and time for their next meeting. She invited Trump to visit China. He also invited Trump also invited him to visit the US. The rare earth minerals which is causing issues over the past 2 weeks now looks to be resolved as per Trump and he said the call lasted 1 and 1/2 hours and it was very positive for both countries. So this is really really good. So, it looks like we probably are going to get a very solid trade deal out of China, out of the EU as well, and that could take us to the next leg higher. However, what did weigh on sentiment today was some of the economic data. Initial jobless claims most notably came in at 247,000, slightly above the forecast right here, but the consensus was for about 235,000. Now, I did say last week we printed 255K. that would be problematic. We didn't get there. But based on all of the employment and labor market indicators we're getting, one thing we are seeing is a labor market that's softening and deteriorating ever so slightly. Look at the look at the ADP numbers for example. However, the Lipmus test comes tomorrow with the non-farmms number. Now, let's quickly talk about Tesla and why it was down 14%. And that's because Donald Trump, Elon Musk were going back and forth. Elon Musk doesn't like this big beautiful bill. He calls it an abomination. He calls it ugly. The spending bill or reconciliation bill I should say. But more importantly, the reason why Tesla was down 14% because Donald Trump on Truth Social said the easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. Now, this is absolutely crazy. These two are literally having a falling out. And the real losers here are actually Tesla's shareholders in aggregate. We'll see how this pans out over the next couple of weeks. Tesla's seen much worse. Don't get me wrong, the company's going to be completely fine. Tesla doesn't need these subsidies to survive, but that is why we actually saw them the market momentum we did today. Now guys, Circle Internet Group, this is a very very interesting stock. IPO today up 181%. They IPOed at $31. Absolutely insane stuff. As you can see right here, very very volatile price action. I think you don't you probably No, I like the business. I like the financials. Um, this is a company that's growing very, very rapidly. But I wouldn't get in just here. I'd probably give it a week, maybe two weeks, let the price action settle, and then if we maybe get back to that $50 range, somewhere around there, I would say that is probably the place where you could potentially get in uh if you had done enough due diligence. I haven't done enough, but I really like the business. They own the They own the stable coin USDC. They've signed partnerships with Black Rockck, with Coinbase, with a whole bunch of crypto providers, and they're rapidly taking market share from their competitor Tether. I think this is going to be a stock to watch. Now, looking at earnings, Dollar Tree reported its earnings up 9%. Absolutely insane. And this is after being up 8% on Dollar General's earnings a couple of days ago. So, it's been a very good week for Dollar Tree. And I think this name is up like 30% year to date, 40% year to date. The dollar stores have been absolutely fantastic. And that's because the company beat on the top line, beat on the bottom line, saw same store sales growth as well as volume traffic very stable in light of everything and tariffs. And look, dollar stores, dollar stores are going to be a real winner if the economy softens and the market realizing it, you know, rewarding uh the the management team for the quarter. They just put up Broadcom, probably the biggest name this week, reported its earnings. It was down 2.4% here in the after hours. It was also down about half a percentage point, guys. Look at this beat rate right here. 17 beats in a row. Absolutely insane. The stock trades at a pretty lofty valuation of 44 times. It's trailing 12 month though, so take it with a grain of salt. And you can see a price to sales ratio of 21. But the company beat on the top line, beat on the bottom line. Revenue grew 20% on a year-over-year basis. And they actually guided for 15.8 8 billion in Q3 which is 21% year-over-year. It was actually slightly above the consensus. So what we actually got here from Broadcom was a double beat right and a raise in guidance but I think the market just wanted a little bit more and that is why the stock was down. Very very interesting trade but as far as I can see there's nothing wrong with this business. This business is firing on all cylinders and I think Broadcom will definitely go ahead and retake the 253 259 260 area uh you know in the next couple of weeks. This is just going to be a small blip on the radar. And I'm going to do a full earnings breakdown of Broadcom on my Finfluential Media channel. So go ahead, like and subscribe. I'll leave something in the comments below. So follow me on there. We do earnings updates every single day. And another earnings update we might do is Lululemon. Now the stock was absolutely crashing here in the after hours, down 18% after being down 1% on the day. It literally went from $330 to 270 bucks. And look, it beat on the top line, beat on the bottom line. Now, I didn't dive into exactly why the stock was falling, but I did see some stuff on Twitter with regards to tariffs and potentially same store sales growth not hitting the mark per se. But yeah, the market not liking this, selling the stock aggressively here in the after hours. Brutal, brutal price action. And here is the earnings we expected from Lululemon versus the earnings that we actually got. But then for everything we saw today guys, there was 2,700 advances, 3,400 decliners, not great breath. We saw inflows in the New York Stock Exchange, outflows in the NASDAQ 100 and the S&P 500 very, very volatile, falling 53% today. And then market momentum, we just can't get above the 100 day moving average. Still at this 46% mark. Um the 150 and 100 day at the 40% level. But the shorterterm, medium-term averages still look really, really good. However, we are seeing a slight deterioration from yesterday from last week to where we are right now. However, however, we are still above the 50% level and that is a win you can take in aggregate. Now, looking at the charts, you can see the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100 down 5.8% respectively, but it was a broadly red day. Uh the RSP did outperform, I guess you could say. Same with midcaps and small caps. The IWM was actually kind of flat, slightly up on the day. So we did see a rotation into some of these higher beta names. For example, ASTS or as Space Mobile, you know, the stock was up 7%, you could see on the day, for example, NBIS, the stock was up 17% here on the day. Some of these higher beta names did outperform relatively speaking. However, when the large caps are down, you know, the market as a whole is going to be down. We saw European stocks gain ever so slightly. Chinese stocks fairly green day to be honest. Volatility did tick up. Yields also ticked up except the 30-year yield which was flat. The dollar was also flat. Bonds mixed. Look, the TLT up ever so slightly because the 30-year yield didn't do much, but the AG down 26% and that's because, you know, yields in in the shorter term treasuries gained ever so slightly. Bitcoin fell 3.6%. It may be diverging from M2 money supply. We're going to talk about it. And then gold fell. Silver was up in a very, very big way. So, silver is to trade right now. It looks like it. and then WTI. But let's actually quickly talk about the S&P 500. So, in yesterday's video, go ahead, watch yesterday's video, I said we're looking for a little bit of weakness to end the week because we were at the top end of the range and we also saw that negative divergence when we pull up the relative strength index. You can see that we had this uh negative divergence and often times it leads the market moving lower. That was the plan especially because we were at the top end of the range and we did pull back. It was not a massive red day for the S&P 500 and we're still like up for the week, don't get me wrong, but a red day nonetheless for the S&P uh 500. And I think uh you know, if this pullback is to continue, we need to look for support here at the 5792. We can't go below this area because then you risk getting into this chop. But in the year in now, but if we do pull back from here, get to this 5792 area, we can then say find a solid base of support and then move up. And then the price action would look something, you know, like this. And then we'll make the next move higher. We put in sort of like an equal low at these lows right here, the 57 92 area. And then we can make our next move up uh for that right there. If this level doesn't hold, we then go down and risk getting into this ugly zone and potentially closing this gap right here. But we'll cross that bridge when and if we get there. Very similar situation for the NASDAQ 100. You can see we pulled back from these highs right here. just a stones throw away from all-time highs. And look, this isn't disastrous, guys. This isn't disastrous. A little bit of a pullback back to this level right here. Actually pretty good. And then we can make our next move to the upside. Very, very similar situation uh to what we see with the S&P 500. But looking for a little bit of a pullback, potentially a higher high, consolidation, then we make the next move from there upward, retake those alltime highs. Very, very solid momentum with this price action. Still looking largely constructive at the top end right here. But it does feel a little labored. You know, there's just so much moving parts right now. Trade talks have stalled. And I think what we really need to get this market moving to the upside is a deal out of China and a deal out of the EU. If we can get those two things solidified, I think the market goes and retakes all-time highs. Assuming the earnings picture holds up, and it has held up so far. Looking at the RTY, very similar situation. And I said, you know, in this range, we want to buy the 2,000 level, looking for a move to the upside. Um, this is a strong level of support and we know that because look at this wick right here. Very very strong long wick. It's also where we have this consolidation period. There's no gap as well. So I think you know if we get to this 202035 level that is the the reason to buy for us to get long especially if we are going to get rate cuts you know in this let's say June FOMC small caps are going to rip to the upside on the back of that news. Now let's actually quickly go ahead look at gold. Now our thesis for gold is we are going to form in this wedge right here and then we're going to make our next move to the upside. That's the bias but we'll see what happens. However, we can actually make a move to the downside as well. It just really depends. So what you really want to look for is are we going to forming this wedge? If we are, then you want to look for a break and confirmation of the pattern with volume. You get that. You can then maybe take the trade to the upside or the downside. Very very technical driven. Gold doesn't really have earnings per se. So it's really something you trade on the technicals, on the volume, and on the order flow. Let's talk about Bitcoin. Now guys, looking at Bitcoin and the big question everybody's asking is are we officially seeing a divergence here from M2? And the the the answer and the answer to that would be yes, we are seeing a divergence. However, it doesn't really matter because that's what Bitcoin does, right? You can see divergences right here, divergences right here, even divergences at these lows right here. So ultimately, what you want to look at is the trend and the path holistically. You don't want to dive into the minutia. Okay. So looking at this, we're seeing a bit of a pullback. We expected this pullback. Now what we want to look for is areas of support looking to make the move to the upside for Bitcoin. So if we just go ahead remove the indicator and actually look at Bitcoin's price in aggregate. If we just zoom in, we can see some I would say ugly price action. You can see we put in a high right here and we sort of got like a shoulder here, a shoulder here, and we've actually broken below the neckline. Some would say this is a head and shoulders. I guess you could look at it like that. The thing with Bitcoin is that these technical patterns don't really work. You sort of just want to look at like key support and resistance areas to find support. And if we actually just zoom out, right, you can see that the next level of support is probably going to be around this 98,000 level. You know, the top end. And I would say that if we are to move lower and we are to look for support area, it's going to be in this range right here where we did a little bit of consolidation. We did a lot of consolidation here. It was the this was the zone right before uh we moved down into this area right here and moved up to these alltime highs. So, that being said, uh even though this does look like a pretty ugly head and shoulders, take it with a grain of salt. And I would say that at this level right here, the 97 98,000, potentially as low as the 93,000 level, this is where you want to look for support if this move continues lower. And I would say the top end support would be right here at the 98,000 level, which would be roughly in line with this right here. So, look, it is diverging from M2 money supply, but it happens. The path of least resistance is still higher, don't get me wrong, guys. And so we are definitely going higher. I believe that to be the most likely outcome. Now let's look at another name. I said that would be a great buy and that's Abocrombi Fitch. I said after earnings, you know, I said you want to take longs right here, you know, at the 95,000 level, maybe sell some in the money puts and Abocrombi Fitch actually outperformed the market of 4.5%. And I think we're probably going to go ahead and hit these uh $100 area right here over the next couple of months. I think this is probably going to be like a bottom. they're going to rip potentially even retaking these highs here at the 104 area. And if you take a measured move, right, um you're looking at potentially 30% upside from where we are. This is the type of signal you kind of want to see when you're trying to get in. So, you know, if you if you think you missed the move, you have it. This is probably the start of the move for Abocrish, but I would still keep the stops very, very tight for a name like this. Still a cheap stock. Um, and you know, you could really take a long year and ride it all the way up back to all-time highs, but that would take multiple months and you'd have to go through multiple quarters of earnings calls. And there in lies the risk. Other than that, another trade I just like is the Bitcoin trade. Um, and then, you know, small caps, uh, midcaps as well, anything in between there. Large capsu probably need a little bit of a breather, but all in all, I think equities look really, really good. Um, I think we are going to go retake those alltime highs. We just need a little bit of digestion, and that'll be completely healthy after the move we've seen. And I wouldn't actually mind a digestion period for like a month or two uh just to shake out some of the weaker hands and then we can make our next move to the upside guys. And let's talk about sentiment. This is the double AI sentiment survey and we pretty much had no change. You could see here bullish sentiment roughly the same at that 32% level. Bearish sentiment roughly the same at the 41% level. Still very elevated bearish sentiment. But I think the reason why we haven't seen any much of a change is because the bulls don't want to get too bullish. The bears don't want to get too bearish, especially as it pertains to where the market goes from here. We're we're a stones throw from all-time highs. And it's just really hard to take a position. If you're long, you're just holding right now and hoping more good news takes us to all-time highs. But at the end of the day, guys, the only thing that matters right now is earnings. And what we're seeing is that 2025 earnings growth expectations have been falling for many sectors except for tech and communications. In fact, tech and communications have been very very solid through this year. Tech, tech, and communications have seen pretty severe downward revisions. And we do know that tech and com services make up close to 30% of the S&P 500, almost 80% of the NASDAQ 100. And if this holds up throughout 2025, I think the indices index, the S&P 500 as a whole should do very, very well and we should hold most of the gains we've made from those liberation day April lows. Now, what to expect for the rest of June, guys? So, this is medium twoe returns for the S&P 500 since 1950. So, we have a large pool of data. And you can see here in the first week of June, we can expect about a half a percentage point gain. But leading into the second half of June, what we can actually see is negative return. So guys, this is also part of the reason why sentiment isn't really moving right now. The bulls don't want to get too bullish. The bears don't want to get too bearish. Also because the macro is starting to show some signs and we'll talk about it now. Inflation is not showing those signs of deterioration. In fact, when you look at the inflation path from 1967 to 1982, this is actually where we ratcheted up higher. We're not seeing that at the moment. But we're actually seeing a divergence in the path of inflation. This is CPI 2015 to present. And to be honest, I think inflation will continue lower, especially if we get some of the deflation risk we're seeing in the numbers. And one of those risks is the employment market. Now ADP reported 37,000. The market was expecting about 115,000 somewhere along there. So it was a huge huge miss. Now this probably means that non-farmms might come in a bit weak. Often times it does, sometimes it's not. It's not a great lead through for non-farmms. And when we look at a more accurate survey, we can actually see right here that federal employment tax receipts is still looking very robust at 3.9% growth. However, when you look at where we are from January, right, printing 11.3, then 6.7, then 6.1, then 5, then 3.9. What we are seeing is that growth is slowly weakening and deteriorating throughout the start of the year. And that also coincides with this number we saw right here. Obviously, obviously the market is going to move on the non-farm number. I think we are probably baking in right now some soft expectations, but we won't try and predict. We will react to the market as it comes. Our data for the rest of the week. Tomorrow, we have the non-farmms. That's the big number. We're looking for 130,000. The unemployment rate to come in at 4.2%. These are going to be the two big things the market's going to be watching. If we miss, things will get very, very ugly. We also get um average hourly earnings month over month. We're looking for.3% there. And then average hourly earnings year-over-year. We're looking for 3.7% data. There's not really much of anything, but if you've made up until here, thank you so much for watching.
