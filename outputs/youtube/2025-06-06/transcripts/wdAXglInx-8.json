  "title": "What's going on with Platinum today?",
  "transcript": "And since everyone seems all hot and bothered with platinum on the old social medias, let's hit it too. Why not? We'll jump in on the old hot trending action. Platinum right now 1139. If you're wondering why we don't talk about it too much on the show, it's not that big of an option story. It's up 8% this week though. Obviously hot week. If you go back to the end of our show, last week's up four and a half percent. Still a good run. Up about 85 handles just since Monday. 1139 and a half is where that front future is hanging out. if you're not tracking platinum on a daily basis and why we don't talk about it every week. 8,300 contracts on the tape and this is a spicy week for them. So, not a huge option stalwart. That said, what is a platinum volume? You might be wondering about a 29 almost a 30 in that AUG contract that has about 40 days to go. The front contract's about a 29 as well with about 13 days to go. That's where half of the paper such as it is went up this week. The big print though actually with almost closing in on 11 half there's 761 of the July 11 halves going up this week but actually the big print is a thousand of the par puts listeners which is kind of interesting. These are going up in October. So let's see if I could pull up some prices for for you because those are actually trading I do believe yeah they traded all today and two of them going up today against an OI of 1100. So they could be closing. They traded for an average price of 13 bucks on these October par puts. So 13 bucks par puts by October listeners in platinum. Are you feeling a little bit of a pullback? Would you be an overrider of those? Mr. Rhodess, are you a big watcher of the platinum? Seems like the kids on the Twitter love it. That's a big move, man. That's and it's the biggest contract for August, September, and October is the 1,00 strike puts. We're all being everybody's gravitating to that round number there. And just looking at the activity on those, it does look like somebody was bailing out of some of those October ones today. So, we'll see if the open interest goes down. I I love it when the volume completely matches up to the open interest. You just know one person was all in there. Everybody knew they were all in there and then we all know when they got out of that trade. So, it'll be interesting to see what the open interest in the October thousand puts looks tomorrow after after they've settled the books, etc."
