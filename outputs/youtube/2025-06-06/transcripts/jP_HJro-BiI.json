  "transcript": "What's up guys? This is Ray J back with another video and this one I want to give you guys a very very quick update about the markets as we're now starting to show some signs of weakness amid some big news that's come out. Um, so let me just talk about some of the drama that's coming out between Elon Musk and President Trump. And there's a lot of things that are going on at least right now. Just know that I am not a financial planner. Take nothing I'm saying as financial advice. Anyways, Tesla is down 14%. It took a massive hit. not looking good because of some huge news that came out involving Elon Musk and President Trump. I think that's having a negative effect on the whole market. Also, the feud between Elon and Trump is not good. Uh, and then there's other catalysts as well they're using to sync the markets. That's part of why we're dipping so far. So, as of right now, that's what's going on. So, what's going on? Musk first said that he does not like the congressional spending bill. He called it a disgusting abomination. He said, \"Shame on those who voted for it. You know, you did wrong. you know it. So, he's not happy about this bill. Okay. He was even liking these memes about how, you know, President Trump is saying he's cutting to he's planning to cut spending and then he ends up increasing spending instead. Like, you know, it's crazy. That's what Musk is claiming. So, that's when President Trump came out and said that he's very disappointed with Elon. Trump said he helped him a lot. He knew the inner workings of the bill better than anyone sitting here. And all of a sudden, he had a problem. and he only developed the problem when he found out we're going to cut the EV mandate. So that's what President Trump claims about Elon. Um the thing is Elon Musk has said in the past that he doesn't really care about the EV mandate. Um and he even repeated that again that he doesn't care about that because um he says it's going to be hurting Tesla's competition more and that Tesla's going to be fine at least nonetheless. That's what he claimed. Um so very very serious stuff right now. Uh obviously they're starting to feud with one another and it's very very serious. So I just wanted to give you guys a heads up about that. Now moving forward I just wanted to say that um you know in response to this we have President Trump saying this he would have won Pennsylvania regardless of Elon. He's very disappointed with him. Then he also said that um you know he was working very hard at Doge. So Trump is saying that Elon worked hard at Doge and he thinks he misses the place. He thinks he got out of there and there's no he's no longer in this beautiful office. It's not just Elon. He thinks that when a lot of people leave they miss it so badly they develop uh Trump derangement syndrome and some embrace it and some may become hostile. So that's what he's saying so far about Elon. Musk then said that without me Trump would have lost the election. The Democrats would control the House. The Republicans would be 51 to 49 in the Senate. So he's saying that, you know, each of them are once again arguing about this. Then President Trump said this, and this is what caused Tesla to crash. The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's governmental subsidies and contracts. I am always surprised that Biden didn't do that. So big news. Now he's saying that, you know, he's considering cutting Elon Musk's governmental subsidies and contracts. Tesla just crashes as soon as this news comes out. That Musk is just uh you know, President Trump is just saying that. Um not the best of news. Obviously, Elon Musk doesn't seem to like or at least Elon Musk claims he doesn't care. He said to keep the EV/s solar incentives cuts in the bill, also cut all the crazy spending increases in the big ugly bill so America doesn't have to go bankrupt because Musk was saying in the past that he believes that um you know if we end up getting these cuts it's going to hurt Tesla's competitors more and that's going to benefit Tesla. Uh however, I do disagree with that. I think that the way I see it is that even if we do get some kind of cuts to the EV mandate, I think it's going to be hurting Tesla to some extent as well, especially since their sales are already lagging right now. Um I do think it's going to hurt them to a large extent for many months, but they will eventually come back and then they will eventually start to offset the losses with um you know either more sales or you know the robo taxi, the Optimus robot in the upcoming years. So, of course, Tesla's going to be fine nonetheless, but I do want to say that I do think that for the immediate term, if we do see lots of incentive cuts for Tesla, it's going to hurt them. That's my opinion, at least to some extent temporarily, right? I know Elon is thinking of like the long term, the long-term Tesla will be fine and he's willing to just, you know, say that, but it is what it is. And then finally, you know, they're just continuing to argue. Musk claims that Trump is lying about him. And you know, the same thing is just going on over and over again. And then there was even more things that were said by Elon. He dropped a very very big tweet which I don't really want to talk about on this channel, but it's it's just crazy, guys. Um he said something very big about President Trump. I just want to say like it's it's just really really crazy. The market's coming down. I mean, if Tesla dumps 14%, a lot of stocks will start to follow. And on top of this, this is very negative news. Um, so with Tesla dumping like this, we're going to see if we could try to hold this support right here at 275. If not, we could be dipping even more. We're going to be looking for 270, then this gap fill all the way down here around 258. So, watch those levels just to be safe. We need to reclaim 300 300 to bounce. If we can't, we're looking more bearish. Um, SPY is looking weaker. We need to get back above 598. If not, we could be dipping towards lower levels like 590 or below. The QQQ needs to reclaim 530. If not, we could be dipping back down to like 520 or below. The IWM Russell 2000 is rejecting off the 200 EMA. We need to reclaim 211. If not, we could be dipping to 205. ES needs to get back above 6,000. If it can't, we got a top right here forming. We could be dipping back down towards 5900. Then eventually 5870. So, keep those levels in mind. For NQ, we have a bearish divergence. We need to get back above 20 uh 21, uh 800 at the very least. If we can't reclaim that, we're looking for 21,400 next. Bitcoin's dumping. We're going to be looking for 100,800 as our potential target. Tesla's dumping. Nvidia is now dipping. There's a gap to fill at 137. 140 does not hold. Um Apple's rejecting right here. We need to reclaim 202. If not, we could be dipping back down to 198 for AMD. Um keep in mind that we might be rejecting here. We could be dipping back down to 112. For Coinbase, we're rejecting right here. We're going to see if 244 holds. If not, we could be dipping back down to 235. Um, Amazon is rejecting. We're going to see if 212 is reclaimed. If not, we could be returning to like 205. Even Meta's coming down. We need to get back above 690. If not, we're looking for a dip back down towards like 675. Um, Google's going to be retesting 168. We're going to see if that holds, if we bounce it or not. And then Microsoft is still bullish. We're still trying to push for 468. If that breaks, we're looking for 470. It's still bullish. The market's looking a little bit weaker. Um, this news about Elon Musk and President Trump is not helping. So, please keep that in mind. Tesla could dip more. Obviously, we were talking about how Tesla should see a big run approaching the robo taxi event, but this news from President Trump makes things more complicated. So, I couldn't have predicted that President Trump would say this. I couldn't have predicted that Musk and Trump would just suddenly start arguing this soon. It could have happened like weeks from now. It could have happened months from now. But if it happens right now, then it is what it is. We just have to, you know, accept it and then be open to the possibility that Tesla could be dipping more. This is another opportunity to dollar cost average down as it drops. But I just want to say to be careful and just know that there is still a risk of more downside for now. I'll talk more about the markets in just a couple of hours. Maybe in about two hours, I'll release another video to just talk about what's going on. Until then, I'll see you guys very soon. Thank you for listening. Be prepared out there and stay safe everyone. Thank you for listening and peace out."
