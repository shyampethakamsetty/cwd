UNH DOWN 2% AND PROCESSER TOCK AND GAMBLE DOWN 1.7% AND SHERWIN WILLIAMS AND WAL-MART. LISTEN, MAYBE NOT HAVING DETAILS ON THE TRUMP, XI TARIFF DISCUSSION AND JUST THAT THERE'S A DEAL AS PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID. WE KNOW THIS, TESLA IS TANKING AND LOOK AT IT NOW. DOWN 16% AND BIGGEST DROP SINCE SEPTEMBER 8 OF 2020. TESLA AT $277 AND BOB DOLL OF CROSS MART SAID HE WAS SHORT AND THERE IT IS NOW. ELON MUSK IS DUMBING ALL OVER THERE'LL'S TAX AND SPEND BILL IN THE OVAL AWES, YOU HEARD AND SHOWING YOU MORE OF THIS COMING UP. MEAS ALREADY IN THE LATE AFTERNOON. WITH JUST 34 MINUTES LEFT TO TRADE AND POSTING ON TRUTH SOCIAL. ELON MUSK FALLEN OUT OF FAVOR AND DO WE FINALLY HAVE THEM IN THE POST AND WISH CHINESE PRESIDENT XI JINPING THAT OFFICIALS FROM BOTH COMPANIES WILL MEET SOON TO TRY AND RESOLVE THE ECONOMIC TENSIONS AND MEANING FOR POEM LIKE OSHKOSH AND IT'S ALREADY GETTING HIT BY A 22.5% DUE I DID IN DUTY IN EUROPE AND TELL HANDLERS AND SCISSOR LIFTS AND OSHKOSH AHEAD OF THE GAME AND OSHKOSH PRODUCING ESSENTIAL SERVICE VEHICLES FROM FIRE TRUCKS AND CONCRETE MIXERS AND COMBAT VEHICLES. YOU'RE COMING FROM THE INVESTOR DAY. >> I AM. >> WHAT THE HECK DID YOU SAY THAT AS THE STOCK JUMPING THIS HIGH? >> >> WELL, WE'VE BEEN UNDERVALUED BY THE MARKET FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND WE LAID OUT WHAT YOU DID AND SERVING CRITICAL INDUSTRIES AND ALL OF US CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT AND IT'S GOING FOR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE MANAGING AT AIRPORTS AND MANAGE THINGS IN NEIGHBORHOODS AND MANAGE THINGS ON CONSTRUCTION SITES AND WE SUPPORT SOLDIERS AND FIRE FIGHTERS. AND WE DELIVER FOR THOSE EVERY DAY HEROES, TECHNOLOGY THAT THEY NEED FOR THE FUTURE. USING JOB AND CONSTRUCTION SITE BECOMING MORE EFFICIENT AND NEIGHBORHOODS WHETHER IT'S DELIVERY VEHICLES OR ENVIRONMENTAL VEHICLES AND WE'RE DRIVING THE FUTURE OF THESE AREAS BECAUSE OF THE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE. WHAT DID YOU THINK YOU SAID THAT HAD REJUVENATED STOCK CERTAINLY FROM EARLIER IN THE SESSION. >> WELL WE GAVE CONCRETE FORCAST OUT FOR THREE YEARS FROM 2028. WE'D NOT DONE THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO GROW BY NEARLY 10% COMPOUNDED ANNUAL GROWTH RATE BETWEEN NOW AND 2028. OPERATING MARGIN UP TO 14% AND DELIVERING 18-$22 OF EARNINGS PER SHARE IN 2028. WE HAD A LOT OF FREE CASH FLOW COMING WITH THAT ALL. GOING AND GIVING ALL THOSE SPECIFICS OUT THREE YEARS, THAT MAYBE WAKES UP THE MARKET. LIZ: ALSO, HOW ARE YOU SO CONFIDENT AMID THE TARIFFS AND DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BUT BY THE WAY, GIVEN UPDATE TO TARIFF IMPACT AND ORGANIZED A TARIFF TASK FORCE AND NOT WAITING AROUND FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO CLARIFY IN ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM. YOU SAID IN APRIL GOING FOR $1 PER SHARE AND DOWN FROM THIS AND UPDATED? >> WE STILL HAVE THE SAME BELIEF THAT MAYBE IT'S GOING TO COST US ABOUT 50% NET THIS YEAR BUT WHEN WE LOOK ATTAR RIFFS, WE HAVE A BIT OF ADVANTAGE IN THIS IN THAT WE ARE IN A -- WHILE WE'RE A GLOBAL COMPANY AND WE'RE IN AN AMERICAN COMPANY AND ALMOST EVERYTHING THAT WE CELL IN AMERICA IS MADE IN AMERICA. GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS AND TARIFF IMPACTS THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH AND GOING TO TALK ABOUT THAT. LIZ: WHAT'S THE WORST? >> WORST TARIFF? LIZ: FOR YOU? >> BIGGEST COUNTRIES WE PAY ATTENTION TO ARE EUROPE, CHINA, MEXICO AND CAB DATA COMMITTEE ARE VERY, VERY IMPORTANT. WE BENEFIT FROM USMCA SO THAT'S NOT CITE AS BIG OF A RISK RIGHT NOW. IT'S CHANGES. WHAT WE NEED TO DO, WE'RE IN KIND OF TWO 90-DAY HOLDING PERIODS AND ONE WITH A LOT OF COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD AND ONE WITH CHINA AND THAT ALL SHAKES OUT AND SEE WHAT THE NET RESULT IS. WE WILL THEN BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK AND WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF THE TARIFFS IN OUR SUPPLY CHAIN AND GOING TO PASS ON PRICE TO ARECAS MERRI BOWLS AND WE WANT TO PROTECT OUR PROTECTING FROM THE IMPACT THAT THIS MIGHT COST. THAT'S OUR ATTENTION. >> WE'RE IN PRODUCTION TODAY AND ALL THAT . LIZ: CONGRATULATIONS. CAN YOU HOLD OFF ON THE PRICE HIKES? >> THAT'S WHAT OUR INTENT IS GOING TO BE AND SEE WHERE THE TARIFFS SHAKE OUT AND ULTIMATE TARIFFS ARE IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES AND THE U.S. POSTAL SERVICE TRUCK IS BUILT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND IT'S GOT A LOT OF TRADITIONAL HOUSEHOLD NAMES AS OUR SUPPLY BASE FROM AMERICAN COMPANIES BUT THERE'S SOME CONTENT THAT COMES FROM PLACES LIKE MEXICO ON THAT VEHICLE SO WE'LL PAY ATTENTION TO THAT . LIZ: ARE YOU WITH PRESIDENT TRUMP OR DO YOU FEEL LIKE THE SEMICONDUCTOR GUYS DO? >> HERE'S WHAT WE THINK ABOUT TRADE. SO OUR VIEW ON TRADE IS OF COURSE WE'RE A GLOBAL MANUFACTURER SO I THINK ANY GLOBAL MANNER IS GOING TO SAY HEY, WE THINK -- WE LIKE FREE TRADE AND HOWEVER, WE LIKE FAIR FAIR TRADE. LIZ: HAS IT BEEN UNFAIR? >> IN CERTAIN AREAS, YES. >> AND WE HAVE HAD SUPPORT FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND DEALING WITH UNFAIR TRADERS WE HAD TO GO AGAINST. >> I DON'T WANT TO CALL ANYMORE OUT SPECIFICALLY AND WHAT WE SUPPORT IS, YES, IF THERE'S UNFAIR TRADE, IT MUST BE DEALT WITH. BEYOND THE UNFAIR TRADE, WE BELIEVE THAT FREE TRADE IS USUALLY THE BEST POLICY IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. LIZ: YOUR STOCK IS NOW UP 7.5% AND CLIMBING AS WE SPEAK AND PEOPLE LIKE THE STORY AND THEY'RE HEARING FROM YOU THERE'S A OPPORTUNITY AND YOUR INPUT COST AND A LOT OF TARIFFS ON ALUMINUM AND STEEL NOW. YOU'RE TELLING ME THAT'S NOT GOING TO HAMMER YOU SOME. >> WE'RE PROTECTED SHORT TERM AND PROTECTING SHORT TERM WITH LOCKS ON RAW MATERIAL BECAUSE WE DO BUY A LOT OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM AND WE HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THAT AND WHAT WE'RE PAYING ATTENTION TO IS HOW DOES THIS IMPACT THE NEST ICK PRICES FOR THOSE COMMODITIES AND THAT'LL DICTATE TO US WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO MITIGATE THE STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS AND THE THING WE PAY PENSION TO MOST ON STEEL AND ALUMINUM TARIFFS IS THAT IF THE PRICE OF STEEL AND ALUMINUM BECOMES EXTREMELY HIGH DOMESTICALLY IN THE U.S., NOT SAYING THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. IT'S WHAT WE PAY ATTENTION TO AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT WILL HAPPEN. THAT CAN MAKE IT TOUGH TO COMPETE AND COMPETITORS IN THE LOWER INPUT COST PAYING ATTENTION. LIZ: GOOD LUCK WITH THAT. IT'S WORKING F"
