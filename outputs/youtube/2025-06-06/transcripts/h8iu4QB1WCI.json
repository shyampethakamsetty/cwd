[Music] Welcome back to our interview series down here at the 2025 options industry conference in beautiful scenic and sunny Palm Beach, Florida. Next up in the Southern studio is a returning guest, even though we only get to chat with him about once a year here at this conference. He is Steve Cork, the chief brokerage officer over there at Robin Hood. Steve, welcome back to the Options Insider Radio Network. Thanks for having me again. It's always good to see you and uh we usually get to see each other in beautiful places, so it doesn't hurt. There are worse things. I mean, usually it's in a room in those beautiful places. We don't get to sit outside at the beach. Maybe that'll be our next series. Instead of the southern studio will be the southern beachside cabana and we'll it might be a little hard from an audio perspective, but we we can make put up with a little bit of wind. Oh well. We'll edit out the waves and the seagulls and it'll add a nice little bit of ambiance. But obviously, we're here at OIC 2025. What brings you through the door? What's bringing you down to OIC this year? What are the the hot things, the hot topics? Or maybe you just want to you want to press the flesh and chat with folks like me. What's bringing you down here this year? Uh yeah, I think there's a few hot topics. Obviously, the NASDAQ proposal is one. And then just generally uh keeping up with all the latest trends. I mean, look, option volumes have been insane lately. I mean, really strong and growing uh across the board. So particularly at at Robin Hood, we've seen some some records, you know, uh in terms of monthly option trading. Um and this volatility of course has everybody's attention and the market moves that you and I were talking about a little bit before we came on are uh are something that uh I think some people are finding options a useful tool to help navigate. Let's start there because obviously the perspective for people right or wrong is that the Robin Hood clientele are more introductory, more basic to the world of options. We're all living through some pretty wild markets. Even if you've been a seasoned professional in the business for 50 years, I don't care. No one's seen these moves and the V and the smattering of a global trade war on top. That has never happened in the lifespan of options. So, these are all unprecedented waters even for the season pros. We've been breaking down some of the numbers like you said, April just a a blockbuster up about 25% year-over-year volume-wise. So just astronomical numbers on top of a already ridiculous growth trajectory. So what have you been seeing over there in Robin Hood in light of these just extreme intraday and whipsaw markets we've been seeing lately? Yeah. So our as you said our customers are younger than you know obviously a history with other brokerage firms where the average age of the customer is much older. Average age at Robin Hood's like early 30s and half of them there's 26 million almost half of them are first time brokerage customers but they've they have lived a lot of them have lived through co it has been a wild 5 years. That's true. They've had a pretty rough introduction. I'm not saying that this is any like this is this is more difficult to navigate than co if and that's saying something but um you know the things that we've seen are what you'd expect um an increase in the number of puts over calls that are traded um because people are are wanting protection but there's also been this and by the way this happens across the industry but it happens at Robin Hood as well so as much as there's differences between people who've navigated markets like this before and people who haven't. There are similarities and some of the similarities are um when things get really volatile, you'll see customers gravitate toward the broad-based ETFs uh as opposed to individual names. And the rationale is um you know look if the market moves down 20% in a short period of time um they have more confidence that um the mark overall market will rebound to a certain extent than they would on any individual name. And it's, you know, it it basically brings diversification into the qu into the into the equation, which, you know, helps. Like no one event is going to, you know, crater their strategy if they're in in the S&P 500 or QQ. I like it. Forced diversification, like diversification at gunpoint. You're like, oh, you know, at least at the end of the day, you know, the S&P 500 probably going to be here in 10 years. Yes. QQQ probably going to be probably. Yeah. Yeah. So, and that happens kind of across you can see it across the industry like the volume you know percentage of volumes goes up both in the equity and the option side uh on the broad-based ETFs and you know now when we've seen we've pretty much rallied back almost all of uh everything since April 2nd um and now you see kind of return to the individual names. So that's probably the most the starkkest thing that that we've seen um in terms of overall customer behavior. you know, we have customers who who relish volatility and look for it and they use it as an opportunity to, you know, to make um trading and and investing decisions. And then we have people that are, you know, just traditional buy and hold and they, you know, since they are in their early 30s, they all understand that they'll be investing for 30 years. So, sure, are they going to take some bumps? Yeah. But you know when you look at history they all understand you know the power of compounding what average returns have been if you go back to 1950 so you know they're just kind of time tested and say I'm going to persevere. I think it is a good point too as you point out you know these last 5 years postco have been a little a little different. uh we you've obviously seen a huge influx of clients. We've seen a huge influx of listeners postcoid and if yeah if you're coming into the options world right around covid time you've seen a lot of crazy things already in your short fiveyear lifespan in the world of options. So maybe we should adjust that frame of reference because there are I'm hardressed to think off the top of my head of a wilder 5-year period to dive in say okay I'm going to start trading options yet clearly clearly folks are you mentioned kind of the zero day stuff that's obviously a hot button issue these days first off and obviously there's a lot of overlap between the Robin Hood clientele and the zero day clientele the two ven diagrams overlap quite a bit is that still the case is there still a lot of interest in zero day these days over there at Robin Hood or has this intraday V has that maybe spooked them a little bit? What are you seeing on the zero day fronted Robin? Uh no that zero day is we've seen the same growth that you'd see in the industry um same interest and I think like I think what's misunderstood because there's so many conversations about zero day and you know some people will write oh my gosh you know exchange put these out that's why people are trading these like the the behavior of customers is driving what's happening. It's not that an exchange put out a product and now they're, you know, being popular. The exchange is catering. The exchanges wish they had that power. I mean, they're catering their customer. So, like I think what gets missed is the duration of people's investments and trades has shrunk across the board. It's not just options, it's stocks, it's crypto, it's picket, futures, anything, any instrument. And some of that actually should happen because you like we're not in 1970. You can't buy a stock and hold it for 150 years. Like some of these stocks are up and down in 10 years. They're in the market, they're out of the market. And so like people have to be more attuned to their portfolios and and you know, look, things happen quick. Look at AI. suddenly boom, here's something that, you know, everybody is enamored with and that came up super fast and it's moving really fast. So, I think um having a shorter duration, that's not to say you can't have a stable portfolio, you know, a core portfolio, which a lot of customers do, but then they have, you know, some portion of that portfolio where they take they take a percentage of that and they're like, I'm going to, you know, I'm going to use that and allocate it toward whatever I think is moving quickly. Speaking of zero day, did you get a chance to see Henry Schwarz's chart yesterday? I love that. I love that one chart is like the one thing everyone has been talking about all for the last 24 hours at the conference. He's always got some good nuggets of data in his back pocket. And he said he snuck this one in right at the last minute. Didn't even get approval for it. And it was going back from the launch of zero day S&P. It was the the execution times and how much volume go up on average per minute pretty much during the day. And it was, you know, your expected spikes at the beginning and end of the day. That's kind of expected. But what was kind of fascinating and he pointed out too is you could see all the bots kicking in and how they're all programmed because literally like clockwork every half an hour there's a spike at 12 p.m. and 12:30 and then 1 p.m. right on the dot. Big spikes of execution. It's like everyone just programmed their bots for the same thing. So Henry now just exposed them. So you know everyone's going to be at home right now. Okay. Now 12:59 is now our new execute. But it was fascinating to see still how programmatic a lot of that stuff is. And so that was I think he'll he'll be on here tomorrow. I'm sure we'll get him to share that chart. I I tweeted it out. I'm not sure if I was supposed to, but it was f a lot of people are already responding to that. So just seeing it broken out in such stark imagery like that. It was kind of fascinating to see still still how programmatic a lot of that intraday trading is. You know, it's it's an important point because um I you know, I started my career on the other side, not not on the retail side. I started my career on the market making side on trading floors and then you know um you know offices and so like when we build things you you have to have an understanding like you know I mean I'll I'll give you examples there were in the past 10 years ago there used to be things like I think they're called walking limit orders but they were basically very predictable orders they would hit the market in a very predictable timeline and that's not good for a retail customer when when Hey, they can see you coming on the other side understand exactly when your market's hitting the order. Like so you have to randomize those things and um and I guarantee you there's going to be changes after after people see what he you know just illustrated. Um, but I think that's an important part like because I I feel like you know there there's so much talk by retail customers and educators and in financial media about what you're going to trade, but there isn't as much talk about how you trade it and the how you trade it. If you're a person who trades frequently is really important. It can change your returns significantly. Well, the other hot thing in the conference outside of Henry's chart is something you just brought up earlier, the the NASDAQ proposal for zero day. We've been talking zero day at this conference ever since they launched a few years ago. Seems like an eternity. It's only been about 3 years. Every time you come down to this conference, we ask our listeners, what do you want us to talk about? And they want to talk about all the Sanders stuff, but a lot of them still want to know, when are we getting the the zero day Teslas and the zero days invidas? And the answer was always maybe. We'll see. It's contra exercises, all these other issues. This is the first year we have a a concrete proposal. Maybe you don't like it, maybe you do, but it's something at least. So, it's what mag seven plus one, I guess, right? So, mag seven plus broadcom. So, I guess the mag 8 now. So, it's an interesting idea. I think it kind of is earning season as well. So, it kind of does a little bit of an end run around that obvious area of risk. What are your thoughts on that proposal? Is that the right way to go or would you have liked to see in something else? Um, you know, we we like to do what our customers want and customers clearly have an interest in. However, the way that we do it is something that, you know, we definitely have uh voiced our concerns over and the concerns are, you know, the risk to brokerage firms and customers is significant when you have expirations and and particularly with the like so you could make some simple changes that would probably mitigate some of these risks or for example um cut off the uh exercise and assignment at 4 p.m. which would really alleviate a lot of risk because you know we as brokers and our customers are wearing the risk on a more frequent basis and I I understand you know we've removed the the um earnings component which is helpful but that's not the only thing that makes stocks have significant moves and so like the the question has always been you know we want to do what's best in the best interest of our customers and we want to deliver what they want but We want to do it in a manner that's going to protect them and us and not sure we're quite there yet. So would you rather have seen just completely axe the uh contra exercise or would you Well, there was also talk about a creating a series of cash settled equity options. Cash see cash settled solves everything but we've I've been marching down that road for a very long time and it's a it's a big undertaking by the prospect of two chains doesn't scare you like you got the cash settled or something else. Well, it's just a big undertaking for the plumbing, the OCC and others to to to uh take on and like I mean I think everybody understands it would mitigate the risk. That's the best way to mitigate all this risk, right? I mean you still have some risk but it's not the significant pin risk that exists today. Someone mentioned something yesterday to me and I thought this might be an interesting way cuz the push back on the cash settle said now we have an entirely new series of options. You have to educate people. Oh, I sold my put on Apple. Why am I not getting stock? They hit the wrong button. And someone said you can make it. You don't have to have two chains. You just hit when you enter the trade. You choose. You choose. You want the cast settle. You want I mean that might be a little bit of educational lift, but at least it's not like going back to the days of the minis where you have all these different chains and no one knows what the hell any symbol is and it's it's just a you know a word salad or acronym salad on on the screen. So I guess if they wanted to go that way, that's one way to go about it. But it seems like people are maybe for whatever reason the NASDAQ thing maybe it's not their perfect choice, but it's a choice. And so some people are, you know what would be fascinating? Um, and I'm sure Henry can do it and you're going to you're going to have them. You should ask them. I'm I'm curious what percent of zero DTE actually settle go all the way through. Yeah, cuz I mean if it's I my guess is it's low single digits. So it's actually telling you what you should be doing. Yeah. you they should be cash settled because people aren't using it. It's it's kind of like saying, you know, this extreme example, but how many people take take uh 40 barrels of oil when they're oil futures? The proverbial truckload of uh crude on your on your lawn at the end of the day. It's a thousand. Is it? Yeah, it's a thousand. Yeah. Now, yes, I have learned that from our new futures rundown show. I've been dragged into the nuances, but I do know it's cushing Oklahoma. Yeah, there you go. There we go. And we all learned that it can go negative in some wild times. So I I had a wild uh wild encounter in the futures market many many moons ago. It was like 1993 when that Gulf War was going on and oil locked limit up. And we were shorted and it wouldn't you know every time it reopened it just locked. So we're like oh my god are we going to have to be driving a rig down to Cushing Oklahoma and delivering this? One of the other things we asked our audience about and they are intrigued about for the conference this year is the whole prospect of 24-hour trading. Now you guys have mostly brought equities. We're pretty much already there almost on the equity front. So the next logical question is what about the options? So do you think it's appropriate? Do you want to see options going 24/7? Should they follow the equities? Should there be some other approach? Maybe a limited time frame or should options just stay the way they are now like just you know opening bell to closing bell and and no after hours? I think everything should trade around the clock. I don't think there should be any exception. I mean, the the the equity um one, we probably have about a thousand symbols. That's on an ATS. The only way we're going to get options is if we get the reference data because they, you know, they have to trade on an exchange. So, you need reference data. And I I know that there's conversations about that in the industry. But, you know, look, the you know, crypto, futures, there's a whole host of asset classes that trade around the clock. They all should. I mean, why I don't I don't understand why they should be closed. We all, you know, I mean, I think we pretty much saw during co there doesn't need to be human beings standing on a trading floor. I know I used to be on one much as I loved it. Uh I don't I don't really think it's uh it's necessary for things to trade around the clock. So the prospect of wild overnight kind of illquid sessions that doesn't that doesn't spook you. I think if you do it the right way, like that's always been the concern on the overnight session. And you know, we we have parameters that we use in order to list securities, but it's also a limit order. So, like it's not people like day trading at 3:00 a.m. It's people that come home from work at 7:00 p.m. They do their research. They say, \"I would like to buy stock ABC at $10. Would you like to buy it at 3:00 in the morning or tomorrow when some old man rings a bell?\" Uh, I really don't care after when it when it gets executed. I just want to buy it at this price. So it makes total sense and and I think the liquidity concerns like there is enough flow now we we watch it diligently um that you know th those markets are almost as tight as they are in the day. We had a uh a good friend of the network and a longtime options educator Alex Jacobson. I'm not sure if you knew him. He passed away over the weekend. And so kind of in his spirit, in his memory, we're kind of asking everyone their thoughts about the overall state of options education, what we could do better. And also obviously you guys at Robin Hood, you're putting up a good share of the pie now. What do you think you guys overall can do to maybe lift the lift the tide of options education? I think it's important that we continue to push on that because there's, you know, there's a well there's a a great amount of options education out there, but I also think that it could be done like we could even do better because there's so many people that are coming into it. The the problem with options education is too often you hear the story of people that say, \"Well, I started trading them and it didn't go well and then I sudden then I got down to educating myself and now I'm generating great monthly income.\" So like the question is how do we get them that education earlier so that they don't have to take the hit? You know what I mean? Um, and like what I love to hear is um, you know, from our customers when they say,\"I have figured this out.\" So, I'm telling my friends and my family, don't start just doing this. Let me show you what you need to read, what you need to understand in order to do this in a sustainable manner. That's cool. I love that. A lot of people have said, you know, especially for your clientele, the Robin Hood clientele, it's hard to get them to come in and engage with whatever you want to do, a 1-hour webinar or sit there and look at your P&L graphs, you know, the old school way of doing education. But there's also the other side which is you can't really convey much in a 30-cond Tik Tok. So there there's got to be some happy medium. You know, where do we find that happy medium? Maybe you hook them with the 30 second super sexy Tik Tok and then you bring them in for a little bit of a deeper dive saying maybe you shouldn't be writing that put right before you know this earnings announcement or these 150 handle intraday swings or how do we bridge that divide between the tick tock hookum and then the actually getting them in for some education? Well, I think you and I have lived it because like you know I when I started my career I was educating people and they were willing to come in on a weekend and spend a day and today people just don't have that time or they don't want to commit that much time which is fine and they want to learn it in a different format you know they want on demand you know snippets of information which is cool we can do whatever they want to do. Um, the thing that I think is most positive, I'll use this analogy because, you know, obviously Robin Hood is, you know, associated with GameStop and AMC and etc. And when those names got hot again about a year ago, a little over a year ago, you know, of course, everybody everybody in media came knocking on the door at Robin Hood. Oh my god, are they back? What's happening? Etc., etc. And we're like, uh, not really. I mean, they did trade them, but not the way that they were traded, you know, back when that was uh a thing. Um, and the point that we made is 80% of the people who came into the market and that's the first thing they did, they're still here at Robin Hood. Now, they have a retirement account now. They're generating income by writing covered calls. Like, they learned. So, to me, it's it's less important how you get into the market. It's just important that you do and then once you do that you get you know educated in a way that's going to make it sustainable. So to me like you know we have we have people that come in through crypto and they say oh yeah I was started trading crypto now I'm I'm interested in creating a portfolio and generating income and that's amazing. I love it. And do you guys have educators on staff? So if someone comes in like you said through with all those different pathways and then they decide they do want to do whatever it is a webinar or something about writing puts that you guys offer that we have we have educators but we also have tons and tons of content and then we partner with people you know because uh yeah a lot of people will point out who they're learning from and so we want to accommodate that and make sure that they're getting that education and then you know you have to be a little careful. Not everybody who educates is doing what's in people's best interest. it might be in their best interest. And so we kind of, you know, help people understand that. There's a reason why we don't have a ton of those guys uh popping up on the network over the years. But, uh, since last time we chatted, you guys have also made some new additions to the platform. You launched Robin Hood Legend. Tell our listeners a little bit about that and what they can do on the options side that maybe they couldn't do before. Yeah. So, we launched um like 95% of all the trading and investing that happens on Robin Hood was happening on mobile. Which, by the way, if you would have told me 10 years ago, 15 years ago, even 5 years ago that the number two option trading firm in the world from a retail standpoint was all being done on on a mobile phone, I would have said, \"No way.\" like there the real estate just didn't doesn't lend itself to that but you know technological advances today are crazy. Um, that said, we have a lot of customers that are recently joining Robin Hood or ones that have been at Robin Hood that are getting uh to a level of sophistication where they said, \"I need more real estate and I want the ability to, you know, to look at uh a more comprehensive charting package or technical indicators and an ability to trade more complex strategies both from an option and equity side. So that's that's why we built um Legend and uh it's been it's been doing pretty well, but we're continuing to iterate on it continuously. So Legend offers all the charting and all the kind of all the bells and whistles people would expect on the option side, all the hardcore people. Exactly. All the hardcore, you know, and and by the way, I I I've learned this and you probably have learned it throughout your career. It everything no matter what you build, there's something that you don't have and we accommodate that as quickly as we can. But you know it the the indicator becomes the darling you know of the month and you know they need it. It's it's the end all be all for them to make money and so we deliver. You know the platform is never done. I was talking about that someone yesterday. They're building us some platform. They said they're close to done. It's like it's never done. It's never done. Yeah. It's kind of fun though because what was really fun about it for me anyway was um we got to start with a blank canvas. So, you know, I've, you know, in my past career, um, I've been part of companies that were acquired. I've acquired companies. So, like the problem with that is you're dealing with all this legacy. And so, like I remember when I first got to TD Maritrade team trading platforms, 15 through serial acquisitions. So, one of the first things we did was just clean it up to like three. But when you have that legacy debt, you don't get to start from scratch and take advantage of all the advances that have happened with technology. We got to do that. It's super fun. It's really cool. I've obviously talked to a lot of people over the years who've come in extolling the virtues of their platform. I'm still waiting for the day where someone walks in and says, \"You know what? We we've cracked it. This is it. This is the perfect 100% done. Drop the mic. We're good. It's yet to happen.\" That'd be a brave person, I think, too. There's also, you know, there are also two other things that that happened in the last couple years. Um the biggest trading firm TDR trade got gobbled by Schwab. So there's a force migration on the technologies that you might not want to be migrated to. Um they kept things they kept thinkers swim and other other technologies but you know when you do those migrations as I said like having been through them I've been bought and I've bought like we bought Scott trade you know we got bought by TDM trade thinker swim did. So when you go through those, it's always messy. You know, it's it's a little messy. You want to do a clean migration. You want to take care of your customers, but you know, no, nobody likes to be told that they're going to adopt new technologies since they didn't choose. Well, Steve, I appreciate you taking some time out of your conference to chat with our listeners a little bit. Before we go, we like to leave our our audience wanting more. So, if you got something fun up your sleeve, any cool hints or teases that the the folks can look to coming down the pike from Robin Hood options, now is the time, sir. The floor is yours. Uh, I would say the one thing that you're going to that we've started to talk about, and you'll see more about it, and it kind of relates to a topic that has been part of many of the panels here, is on the AI front, and how that can be useful for people on the option side in finding uh opportunities and trades. And I think we're just scratching the surface of u of what can be done there. Um first thing is delivering content you know aggregated content when you have a portfolio or a desire to do something. Second iteration of that is now what do I do with it? What's the best what's the optimal op you know option strategy you give me a couple variables that matter to you like duration you know return and we can deliver you a couple no pun intended options. The first thing you have to do if you're building an AI is tweak it so that it doesn't trade spx zero day on the every half an hour like clockwork at least 29 minutes in or 101 or something but on the hour on the half an hour that Henry busted that now so that's uh that's no that's no good every 15. Yes. There we go. There we go. Well, Steve, like I said, I appreciate you taking some time out of your day and we'll look forward to seeing how all this unfolds at Robin Hood. Hopefully, we'll get a chance to chat between now and the next OIC and see how all this unfolds in the marketplace. Thank you very much for having me.
