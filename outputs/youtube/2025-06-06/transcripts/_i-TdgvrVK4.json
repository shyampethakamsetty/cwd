  "transcript": "Hey everyone, hope you're having a good day. My name is Andy. My channel's Finding Value. Uh today we're going to go through Twitter, see what people are sharing on social media. I'll interject my financial opinions as we go through it. Generally related to three different topics: wealthb buildinging, commodities, andor financial topics. So let's dive right in, take a look, see what's going on. You want to follow me at ferscore finance. If you want to join our community, findinghenvalue.com where I dive deep into the sectors looking for investment opportunities and sharing it with everyone in the community. If you're interested, we do have a coupon code. Special is the coupon code that is uh still active. You get 50% off the monthly membership for the first month only and a larger discount on the yearly membership. All right, we went Jordan Roy. He says, \"Bank of America clients say gold is the most overvalued it has been in 20 years. In 20 years, everyone will agree gold was extremely cheap 20 years ago.\" Well, let's let's let's take a quick look real quick um on some metrics if that is in fact the case. So, this is gold divided by the M2 money supply. So um one could say uh that we are at least in relationship to the to the M2 money supply we are getting a little bit more expensive uh compared to the last 20 years. That is true. Uh it was incredibly cheap here and here uh which was just back in 2022. But we have come up uh quite a bit in the M you know gold to M2 money supply. uh it is by no means uh anywhere near 1980 which was way up here. We would have to go up and let's let's see how far we would have to go up to to match that. So from where we are today to match it. Uh we would need to go up 282% against the M2 money supply. So we would have to outperform the M2 money supply by about 3x. 34x. So 34x away um is is what we would need to do if the end money. So from where we are today, if the M2 money supply was held constant, which it won't, we would need to go up three to four times from where we are today. So we would see, you know, 9,000, $12,000 gold, something like that, or or more, 12,000, 13, 14,000, $15,000 gold. um if they're printing a bunch of money on top of this that just raises that price. So maybe it's 20,000 gold or 25,000 or 30,000 by the time we get to this ratio and by the you know by the time N2 money supply is blown up um it'll just keep going up and up and up away from you know uh increasing the gold price. We can also look at gold uh in relationship to say like the S&P 500. Um, this one still looks incredibly cheap. We haven't really moved that much. We hit a little bit of resistance here uh recently for gold versus the S&P 500. We're putting in a gigantic double bottom and then I think this is going to go all the way up and go all the way up to some level up here. I do think that's going to be the case. Uh, if we were to do something like that, we're going to see gold outperform the S&P 500 dramatically. Um, I am not 100% sure if the S&P 500 goes down uh where we see a contraction or uh if we see the S&P 500 go up and and gold goes up way faster like in a a very high inflationary period. Uh it's possible that the S&P 500 grinds sideways for a long time, 10, 20 years, and gold just rips it. So um I would say looking at these particular metrics um gold is not expensive compared to financial assets um it it you could say that gold is expensive to platinum, gold's expensive to silver, gold is expensive to crude oil. So you could use those metrics and say that it is overvalued compared to history against other commodities. I would prefer to be invested in those other commodities than gold. At this exact moment, gold has done incredibly well. Uh it may still have some, you know, some left in the tank to move higher, but again, I still prefer the undervalued assets always going to the dude. The silver market traded 437 million paper ounces yesterday. The comx had 119 deliveries and the LVMA had 820. If we can pass $35 silver, it will move quickly to 50. After 50, the sky's is the limit. What happens when you manipulate an asset for over a hundred years? I don't think the assets been manipulated for over a hundred years. If if the asset is manipulated, if it is um we would see shortages of silver, I don't think it was manipulated for that period of time. What I think they did is held the silver price down on the cost curve as long as they could. The cost curve still went up, but they were they would hold it kind of on the cost curve as as time went along. And there was a couple of times in history where uh the price went up dramatically above the cost curve. That that's what I think is going on. How many people you know own gold? How can it be in a bubble? I don't know that many people who own a lot of gold. Um, everyone that I am related to um owns some metals. It It's not zero. But the people that I don't know very well, I would say that the majority of people do not own any gold. In fact, they probably don't even know what it looks like. Like if you were to put it in their hand, they'd be like, \"What is this?\" But for most people, I mean, that's kind of what they would say about anything that you ask them. You could say to them, you know, \"What's the difference in octane rating, 87 and 91? What's the difference? Why do you need 91 versus 87?\" They don't know. You could ask them all sorts of things. Um, you could ask them about computers. You could ask them about the internet. You could ask them about their car. They don't know. Though I would say most people don't know much about anything. So, um, that's kind of my conclusion after talking to people. Um, they're not going to know, you know, what spark plugs are. They don't know where to put them. They don't know how to change. They probably don't even know how to change a tire. And I would say that's pretty useful if you're on the side of the road with a flat tire. But, yeah, silver stocks are breaking out versus silver. Uh, last week, GDXJ and GEX broke out against gold. Now it's Sill and Silj are breaking out versus Silver. And I posted that yesterday. And here's another um look at it from Jordan. Uh so yeah, these look good. This looks like a double bottom here for Silj versus Silver. And this one's kind of a roundish bottom there, heading higher. So yeah, I think this all looks really good. And I think Silj's going to rip it. the juniors. I mean, I think we're gonna we're gonna we're gonna kill this thing in in the uh on the website here on the juniors. Um Anas says, \"I will make the case for investing in oil and gas. Oil and gas demand will continue to grow for decades to come.\" That's a good enough case. I don't think the supply side's all that robust after 2025. Uh we do have some some projects coming online in 2025. Uh and it could slow down the the the pricing. We could stay down for a little bit, but again after 2025, things look pretty pretty bleak in terms of uh projects coming online with any sort of growth that's going to move the needle. I also think shale is going to dramatically slow down over the next decade from where we are today in terms of uh production and supply. I think it'll roll over. Coming down, we've got Nugget Capital Partners. Oil is barely down on the Saudi boost story. Seems like the oil bears are running out of bullets. What happens if the macro narrative turns? And that's that's where I'm at. What happens if we turn the macro narrative from bearish to bullish? What happens? Well, the oil bears are going to get overrun by the oil bulls. It just takes time. And again, this is the information. Saudi Arabia is advocating for more substantial production cuts within the OPEC plus group to regain and expand its market share amidst fluctuating oil prices. This approach aims to stabilize the oil market and potentially increase prices as the kingdom looks to strengthen its position in the global energy landscape. I don't know how they can I don't even know what that means. I mean, like really try to absorb that. They're going to try to increase the they're trying to regain and expand its market share. And this approach is it it aims to stabilize the oil market and potentially increase prices. I don't know how that's possible. How is adding more more oil to the market going to potentially stabilize it and increase prices simultaneously? I don't know if that makes any sense. Uh uh Brent just tanked below 65 as Saudi Arabia reportedly pushes for supersized output hike by August September. Maybe they need to increase it to keep the price relatively stable because if shale is going to roll over um they're going to have to bring on more barrel. Saudi Arabia know maybe it has something to do with the rollover in shale. We might lose, you know, three, four, five, 600,000 barrels of oil and these guys are just coming up behind it replacing it. Maybe Joseph Brown says theft is taking something that belongs to someone else involuntarily. I think he's talking about taxes here. Uh, this definition doesn't change whether it's one person involved or 300 million. And and that's, you know, I've made this argument too. um people voting away the property of another um that doesn't make it right. So we should put in the laws which we used to have but we should come back to it and say you know what maybe only certain people can vote those that have a stake in society. Um and then you have a limited uh people who can vote. You can't vote property away from from someone else. And and if you're increasing the money supply and doing these big bills, uh that's why the founding fathers put in the constitution that gold and silver are money and and needs to be backed by money. If you unlink it, then you're you get screwed. I mean, basically, you're just stealing purchasing power through the currency from everyone. And that I mean, that is theft. That should be illegal. I mean, that's why we we created the Constitution, created gold and silver and made that money was to prevent the craziness of government to run these big fat deficits. It's crazy. Gold is the safest reserve asset. It is free from direct links to the economic policy of any country, resistant to crisis and retains his real value in the long term. Adam, which is the governor of the National Bank of Poland, which has been among the biggest buyers in recent years. Yeah. Maybe they're smarter to to run their country the way that they are. Saudis want more superersized OPEC plus hikes and push for market share. Here comes another fake Saudi league. Yeah, I don't know how legit these uh these leaks are. Um we started to break out in oil. So, we were right. So, here's oil. Let's go to oil real quick. We were right in the morning trying to break out. Um here it is uh in the morning. So, in the morning, we're sitting here. We're going higher right off this here, trying to break out. Then they released the article right in the circle there, and then they pushed it lower. You know what else turned? Just so happened, what else turned at that at that time? The 2-year yield turned. The 10-year yield. So, it opened up and then it just so happened that these turned roughly. Let me see how well this correlates here. There it is. So, they're trying to push yields down. They're like, \"Well, if we push oil down, we can get yields to drop further.\" And there we go. We push oil down, push yields down at the same time. Um, again, I wouldn't get frustrated with it. We It's out of our control, but I'm staying long oil and just waiting. I'm waiting. I know they're trying to push the the yields down and and we'll see if they I don't think they'll I I don't know if they'll go to the extent that they did before. Maybe C19. I'm not sure if that was completely a fluke. Um or uh during 911 that dropped yields pretty quick. Um and they were both whenever, you know, they were both they both occurred when the banks were all in bonds, which is kind of weird. Um, but the the big the big banks, they're not necessarily positioned in bonds. Um, well, I'll put it this way. The the we don't see the yield curve uninverted yet. So, we we're not seeing a run towards bonds at this time that indicates that a demand destruction event is going to occur immediately. So, I'll I'll say it that way. Another one from Nugget Capital Partners. She says just over a month ago, Amorita Sen was calling for $75 a barrel oil and said she was going against the grain all the big banks. Now she's saying there's no hope and that any oil priced rallies will be capped. Never understood how this firm woman was so revered by the media and even Nuttle. Oil rallies will be capped says Emora in oil trading above 60. can't see how we go to 70 or $80 unless there's a big geopolitical outage. So, that's her opinion. I know some people get impacted by other people's opinions and I'm just sharing, you know, people's opinions here. It doesn't impact mine. I'm still rhying through this. And even at these prices, I think a lot of it's priced in in the market already. So, then the question then becomes, what's the likelihood that we'll see, you know, $50 a barrel oil? If you think it's pretty unlikely, uh, then I would just stay long. That's kind of what I would look at. Now, there's a lot of people that are deathly afraid of a recession. And if we get a recession, then yes, it's going to obviously weigh on oil prices for sure. But if demand, which is pretty resilient, we haven't really seen even during recessions a a pullback in demand. What we usually see is the growth slows down. It it doesn't grow as fast. Now, there's a couple times in history where, you know, 2008 where we we lost about a million barrel barrels of oil demand, but one also has to look at shale oil and how much we're going to lose out of that. staying down here in the 60s. Um we could lose 500,000 to a million barrels uh production a day on the supply side if we stay around 60. So the market's trying to price this all in. We'll see what happens. Here's uh the Department of Energy stocks for week ending 530. So we had crude that was down 4.3 million barrels, but we did get a a build in gasoline and distill it plus five and plus four. So we we yanked down crude oil on the upper left here. Uh but we did get builds in gasoline distillates little bit in Cushing stock there. Not much there. And refineries of they were just running full tilt converting oil uh into gasoline and diesel. US crude production looking pretty flattish for May 30th. The Crude Chronicles 2024 oil and gas exploration expenditures were the lowest on record. That's crazy. Or at least the records that I keep going back to 1956. That's crazy, guys. Look how low we are compared to all of of the other years before us going to 1956. And that's that's obviously adjusted for 2024. This is inflation adjusted. the lowest since all the way back then. Uh, Jacob King says, \"Which degrees do the most millionaires have?\" Engineering is number one, econ number two, politics three, mathematics is four, computer science is five, and law is number six. Does this surprise you? No, doesn't. Um, the way that I would look at this is there's personality traits, there's IQ, and then there is also the number of people in each of those areas. So, what you're doing in my opinion is probably just taking the largest, smartest group of people and then seeing who has the most millionaires. um politics I they I'm surprised it's number three but if we if we were running a say top you know top economy or top government you generally want to minimize your government politics workers uh engineers there's probably a lot of them they generally make good money they generally save their money and are conservative most of their jobs all they do is try to uh make things more efficient. They can also fix things themselves, a lot of it. So, a lot of it is just keeping your money in your pocket and just keeping it in investments. And that's exactly what engineers do. They also understand math. They understand compounding probably better than anyone else on there outside of maybe number four mathematics. But yeah, it makes sense to me. Unusual Wales. said 40% decline in the US dollar would wipe out the US trade deficit says Deutsche Bank. A 40% decline in the US dollar wipe out the US trade deficit. That's a pretty big move. That's I mean you're cutting it in half almost. We'll see what happens. We'll see if that occurs. Uh Winston Wolf, you think miners have peaked? This chart of GDX relative to gold shows that we're just getting started. the ratio has just broken out above resistance. At least someone else is looking at the same stuff that I am. I look at some of this and I get confused. I'm like, well, go look at your your tech and all that. I mean, those those ratios are inverted. They're all way up here peaking while these are all bottoming. The whole cycle is turning right in front of us, guys, where tech is probably going to eventually peak out and gold's bottoming out and the miners. So it's all it's all happening in front of our face. Great features. AM update dry ball cape size Panamax up cape size up big 6% Panamax up two. Tankers we've got VLCC down 1%. Sew Max up 1%. Hi Heat coming in with the heat says in the Middle East oil demand has grown much faster than supply for the last 20 years. The scale and pace of new road building across the Middle East surged in the mid 2000s, particularly around 2005. Wall Street apes. We've got a farmer explaining why Liberals push for electric vehicles is currently impossible for farming. Someone asked why we don't use electric tractors to seed with. And here's why. He said, \"I seated 6,000 hectacres, 23.17 square miles. It took around 30,000 L of diesel, aka 321,600 kwatt hours of energy. To do that in an electric tractor, I need the battery from a Tesla semi recharged 322 times. So, even with a super fast industrial 350 kW charger, that's 918 hours of charging, more than three times longer than the actual job. Someone asked me about solar as well. So, even with a massive 100 kilowatt system, it take nearly 2 years to match the diesel energy used. And to keep up with the job in real time, you need a solar farm bigger than 45 football fields. That's how energy dense diesel is. It's it's nature's batteries. Nature's batteries and how it has put these pools around the world of nat gas and oil is far more energy dense than trying to uh absorb scarce sunlight and and the batteries they're not going to replace tractors. It's just not energy dense enough and it can't recharge fast enough. Rainey says, \"This is what real hyperinflation does to a stock market. Early in the move, stock markets moves outweigh inflation. Later in the move, stock market gains are nowhere near the rate of inflation. Many will be fooled by Western stock markets going up hugely when the time comes. It is imperative to understand how things actually work. Then also add resulting depression plus CBDC's, bailins, coming capital controls, bank closures, severe ownership issues, how long physical will be available, etc., etc. And it quickly gets complicated. It is vital to piece the puzzle together in order to understand what is coming and in order to be prepared in detail in every way needed. And this is the Argentina stock market. Uh from 2011 to where we are today, it is up 16,000% in 8 years. Well, I guess he only calculated it in eight years. 16,000%. But you know what? Know if silver and gold are up more in Argentina's currency, what we're measuring when we So here, I'm just going to do one quick thing here. This is gold. Uh, this is the big move in gold. We can put it in white. It's a little bit easier to see. Right now, when I change this, you can see a different pattern. So, I'm going to change it to um a different currency. So, let's do uh let's just do peso, right? So, we can do the Mexican peso. That's what the Mexican peso looks like. We can do the Japanese yen. So, JPY, Japanese yen. That's what the Japanese yen looks like. We had a little bit different pattern here. Basically, resistance right where we're at and then the big move. This is exactly what is going to occur in uh silver priced in dollars. You get the big cup, get the handle, and then this thing breaks and then it just runs and runs and runs. And really, what we are charting isn't it's not gold. What we're charting is this is I'm gonna do something here. Let me grab this. Got to grab it with this. So, what we're charting if I can do this. One second. Let me see if I can flip this thing visual. What I'm trying to do, if you flip this over, you're just charting the value of the currency. Gold didn't change. This is all currency related moves. So I can put up whatever you want. You want to put up the the South African rand. Look at gold priced in the South African rand. It's just been going down, down, down, down. So what's coming last is just the dollar. The dollar is getting smoked. And that's what we're pricing all of this in. So all of this is just currency. The Argentina stock market didn't go up and outperform it was the currency. Let me see if we can get Argent. Here's the Argentine peso. Then he's got um he's got dollar something. I don't know what that one is. One second, guys. Argentina Merval index. So, so here's the S&P um Merville Argentina index. Then we can put gold on top of that. And then in gold. So this is what it looks like if we were to compare the Argentine index versus gold. And you can see more recently that gold has outperformed uh the Argentine index. Um during the recovery phase in 2009, you can see that this outperformed at the beginning here. Uh but if you get closer, you can see gold's really outperformed the past four, five, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 years. Um so that's that's the comparison there. Gold's outperforming the index. Uh you could also divide it by gold. See what that looks like too. So yeah, this is all just currency related garbage. It's all it is. US government interest payments are going ballistic. This is not even parabolic. This is vertical. From COVID lows, everything changed and the technicals anticipated it. Personally, I do not think Washington has raised the debt ceiling 80 plus times, frequently changed CPI definitions, printed many extra trillions, inflated Fed balance sheets astronomically, etc. Just in order to in the end start fighting inflation in a real way that is highly unlikely. Governments change CPI and PPI definitions continuously for many reasons. One of them being trying to protect the present monetary system. One could look at shadow stats which gives more accurate numbers. But reality is that measuring inflation correctly is actually very difficult when you really look into it. So what's the answer? As I see it, the real measure of inflation is the expansion of the currency supply. Totally agree. And government interest payments is more or less a function of the expansion of the currency supply. Knowing this, the chart below becomes pretty scary. It shows that the co lows was in a historical inflection point where the US government interest payments went vertical, literally. Gold always catches up with government debt and currency supply and gold is now responding. Both gold and silver have broken out hugely 15 months ago, held both breakouts in real time and both are now in a resumed bull market. This commodities bull is the largest financial opportunity we will ever have and the largest financial threat we will ever face. Make sure you get the most out of this bull market. And this is the US federal government interest payments 50-year chart and it's starting to go vertical for their interest payments. Um this is where nothing stops this train comes in. Can't stop it. So right now, gold is reacting and it reacts the quickest of all of them. Silver and platinum will react next and so will oil and all the other commodities. They are all about to go vertical. And these guys are screwed because they can't shut it down. They're going to try to they could do QE and try to bring interest rates down, but they're just going to destroy the currency. I mean, they are going to destroy the currency and all of that. I just you know this is all currency destruction. It's not going up because of economic activities. It's getting destroyed by currency. This Argentina index and gold priced in Argentine peso or whatever it was. It's all currency related. The currency is about to get smoked here. That's what's coming. Here's another chart. This is not gold going up. It is mostly currencies depreciating. Totally agree with that call. And it's not only a normal bull market. It is a monetary system reset. So for heaven's sakes, do not miss it. Gold quarterly 50-year chart. This thing's going to go vertical here. He says the target 15,000, but he might raise it even further later. possible time span for the fifth Kwave to top. If it's right translated, then we top beyond 2028, which would be very reasonable for this bull market. And if and we top in 2034. If the fifth Kwave is similar to the fourth Kwave and this is the fifth Kendra wave, K waves have lasted 54 years on average. Note that the Kadatio macro cycle is a so-called long cycle and it is not to be mixed up with the comprehensive technical tool cycle analysis. Examples of other long cycles are the 8-year gold cycle, the 15-year commodity cycle, plus the 18-year debt cycle. So, all these things are kind of adding up uh cycle-wise to make this big move. It's coming. Uh here's silver multi-deade breakout right here on a it's probably a yearly chart is my guess 12 month uh here we are breaking out guys this is going to run it's going to run big it's going to run big so the way that I'm preparing for this and and obviously I share a lot of this stuff on the website is I'm getting in companies that are gold silver mining companies uh oil companies all these things that are hyper sensitive to inflation Platinum is hyper insensitive to inflation. It's more so than even silver and gold. So, we'll see. We'll see what happens here. Everything looks good to break out everything. That's all I've got for today. So, we're going to end it there.
