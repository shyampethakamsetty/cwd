  "title": "URGENT: Trump Just CRASHED the S&P 500",
  "transcript": "Okay, the S&P 500, the NASDAQ 100. We have a lot to talk about here on the day. You can see SPY here on the day is it is down $2, almost $3, but dropping here in the after hours. That being said, you were looking very good and something did happen early on or later on in the day cuz you were pushing local highs. Again, we were pushing towards 600 like we talked about, but you found sellers as the day progressed. And I'm going to tell you right, I'm not going to BS you. I'm going to get right to it. Basically, you have the rumble in the jungle of events between Donald Trump and Elon Musk. Um, you've had Elon Musk accusing Trump of being on the Epstein files. You have Elon Musk saying Trump would have won the election without him. Elon Musk is saying that a recession is going to hit happen to the market in the second half of this year based off of Trump's tariffs. Um, the spending bill is going to push the Americans into slavery. These are all words Elon is saying. I'm going to do my best to not make this video a video on Elon, Tesla, and Trump. I'm going to make a video later on that as well, but I want to make this video more about the market, what to expect, and what to be looking for, okay? Because up until 11:00, 10:00 today, you were looking great. You were looking awesome, right? And it's important that you understand what was happening until that happened, right? I mean, you were booming, right? We were we were moving NASDAQ almost into 22,000. I mean, we were just you're just printing money to the upside, right? The the story didn't stop. And then on top of that, you had news out of China and uh with Trump calling uh President Z of China, right? So things were working in the favor of the market, right? In a great way. And then like I said, things took a sharp turn when this happened. Now the thing for me when I the more I look at this is like man I was a little bit unaware that Elon had this much influence on the economy. So I don't want to go into this in the mentality of like saying okay this is it you've topped out you have to drop this this and this is going to happen because I don't necessarily believe that. Now again this is one move this is literally four hours of price action. So we need to get more overall reaction seeing what's happening there right now. I'm gonna spend a lot of time today on the chart. Okay, we don't have a lot of news coming out tomorrow. I think you have non-farm payrolls, which that is big, don't get me wrong, but you have some unemployment data, but nothing crazy. I think it's going to shake up here. So, when I'm looking at the chart, I'm going to get rid of the level. So, you can see again right now, what I will say that's bad is you have around 700 points on the NASDAQ back into the 200 SMA. That's red flag number one. That's that's worst case scenario as far as being bearish is just seeing a retrace back into the 200 SMA, right? ES, you're basically like 40 points away. That can happen quick. You were literally there on Monday. Wouldn't be surprising to me if we touched that at all. So, I'm waiting to see how we react in the after hours. How does Asia, London react to the market? Do we find buyers and what really develops over time there? So, that's what we really have to focus on today of the levels you need to be watching going into the next trading session to understand what to do and how to kind of navigate the market. Now, before we do that, I want to say right now, if you're interested, you want to see how we trade everything that we do, the link to Discord is down below. You get to see how we trade every single day. I go over futures before the market ever even opens. I go over my top trades, what I'm expecting overall, etc. Right. So, again, uh, one of the things that I mentioned today, this morning, was going into a firm. And I want to go really close quickly into that as well. I keep like not being able to find it, but I called out a firm today. That was one of the big trades that we had here. Monster trade did really, really well. um mentioned it this morning as well. So that was one of the big ones that we had there. You go a little bit further, we had more trades as well. We had um yeah, affirmed the 200 SMA pushing to 5758. That was one trade there. Tesla to the downside went short on that as well below 317 down to the 100. Then the 200 then we went short again. So again, another monster trade there. You had Meta above VWAP breaking into 1969. So again, there's a lot of trades there as well. Jordan's calling his trades all all day as well. So if you want to see how we trade, what we trade, that might be for you. The link is down there so you can see the profits from Discord as well. So again, that's all there for you. Education, recaps, all that stuff. Now, going a step further looking in the market. Okay, right now I think some of the biggest areas that we have to look for is number one, what else does Elon say? And again, this is this is like you're not going to you're not going to be able to predict this because I mean did if I woke up this morning and had my bingo card, Elon Musk accuses Donald Trump of being on the Epstein list, it wouldn't have been there. It wouldn't have been on my third bingo card. Okay. Um, is it crazy to think about? Not really. Not really. Like it's totally possible. Like to be totally honest, but I wouldn't have expected Elon to go so drastic, right? He went from saying he loves Donald Trump as much as a straight man can love another man to saying this. So, what you have to be looking at and then how the market is also responding to that. Now, from there, again, I'm going to go straight into levels because I think that's what really matters here on the day. as you look at the S&P and we look at SPY. A few things that I wanted to see overall bringing the levels back up here is I wanted to see us hold above 595. Obviously, that didn't happen. Now, we're looking at 590, 590.7. If that breaks, you're looking for 586 and then under 586, you're looking for the gap fill near 581, 580, then into the 200 SMA. That can start to snowball really quickly. Staying on SPY and the S&P 500, I move towards ES and what's happening there. I think ES is in a world of pain in the short term. Not like not a crazy amount, but I think ES is pretty likely, right? Pretty pretty likely to I have to move this level just so you can I just put the level around top of the 200 SMA right there near 58.97 58.98 near 6 5900 flat, right? I'd be willing to bet heavy that you're going to test that tonight or tomorrow morning. Very likely. If you don't, that's incredibly incredibly bullish in my personal opinion. If you continue to make stronger higher lows off this, you don't even get a real retrace. That's a great sign right now. My gut here, just outside looking in, yes, this is a stronger reaction some of the sell that we're seeing from the highs on the day to where we are now. I don't think this is going to be what carries us to downside. Could it be? Maybe. We'll see. You lose the 200 SMA, things could change really quick. Now, from there, we go into NASDAQ and QQQ. Now, QQQ, you're respecting your levels like perfect, right? You got a little bit above 531, quickly got back below it on the hour, went down to 527, flipped. As you can see, it rejected there. Now, you're pushing back down to 521. You lose 521, you're back in your range. And this is why I'm saying that I don't I'm not at that point of being super concerned just yet, because you're just back in your range, right? Remember, we talked about this. You sat here for basically 3 weeks, right? just sitting in a box, rectangle, whatever you want to consider it. NASDAQ, you can really see, you know, you sat in this range like nothing has really changed. So, before everyone freaks out, you have to, you know, take a step back and say, okay, how have we been here before? And yes, you're at levels you haven't seen since Monday evening. Like, very important to understand that. And if you bounce here, you look really good. So, important to know where we're at, what what's happening so far. Now, also too, you did have some earnings here tonight, right? You had AVGO, which again, AVGO has been one of the top stocks out there in the market. Um, we all know it's been the best performing semiconductor. Um, and they did beat, they did well on earnings, but again, you're getting a pullback. Now, someone asked me in Discord today, like, did I like AVGO for earnings? I don't typically like trading earnings at all, but I really don't like betting long on earnings when a stock is pumping into its earnings, especially if it's like a large cap name like top 10. It's just a risky. There's no real reward opportunity. Like so to make money on AVO earnings, you would had to hit like 270 in the after hours. And I wouldn't wanted to bet on that, right? But right now, what am I watching on AVGO? And I'm going to go into why this is so important is again just your previous highs right here. So you can see uh 251, 252. How do you react there? Again, just seeing can we get that continuation and where we're at. SMH has been one of the biggest catalysts here. Again, we talked about this. You got above 239, you pushed into 253. We also talked about the range in which you were trading in, which was right here. And again, now today again, you know, as bad as things look on the end of the day, right? From the outs looking in, if you just, you know, went to lunch and came back to the end of the day like, oh god, this looks terrible, right? As bad as that all may sound, all you're doing is breaking out and retesting most of these highs right now. The question is, do you bounce? Do buyers show up where they need to show up? That's that's the real question. So again, I'm not going to get in the game of predicting X, Y, and Z. I'm usually in the game of reacting to the levels that we're watching. So if we start losing back below 240 on S SH and semiconductors start to roll over a little bit, then yeah, just trade the downside, trade the bottom of the range of where you're looking at. That makes the most logical sense. But you don't need to be the person that's getting in at the absolute top or the absolute bottom. You can typically wait, make sure the trade gets in your favor and execute based off of that. And you put yourself in a much better position to win a trade every single time when you're just a little bit more patient. Yeah, you may take some of your profit potential off the table, but typically you can reduce the the chance of you losing that trade by just waiting a little bit longer, which is usually what I recommend, right? Unless I have a very strong feeling. If you have that strong gut feeling, don't let me discourage you. YOLO it. Do what you got to do, man. Right now, as far as stocks, I'm liking it to tomorrow. Now, we'll start with the weak names. Obviously, the weakest names, in my opinion, I think Tesla is is is is the dog in this race right now. In my opinion, the biggest level you're watching is 271, give or take. If you start to lose 270, 271, I think this thing rolls over quick, right? I mean, the fact that you went below your 200 SMA and dropped another $20 is beyond me. But if you lose 270 here, 271, I'm targeting 262, 263 in an in in a hurry, right? Um, and again, if Elon continues to attack this and go at this, you have to assume the market looks at this from a sell side, right? Or sellside type of trade. The next stock that I'd be looking at too is Apple. Um, Apple continues to reject the 203.8, 204. I told you guys yesterday what we did and honestly one of our best like trades of the year was this this action on Apple. And everything that I do here is always based off the levels that I talk about, right? Um, I'm never like keeping like some secret ace in my pocket that's like, \"Oh, I didn't tell the boys about the trading plan, right? Oh, secret trade alert. Secret trade.\" It's not how this really works, right? So, if I go into technicals, I go back to yesterday's action here on Apple. All I did here on Apple right here, trying to mount this is yesterday 8:37 a.m. We're looking for the mount of this level 23 203.8 into 206.3. And then as we progress, I was like, \"Look guys, you're looking weaker. So, as we hit this level, I'm looking to go short near 206 back to the downside. Literally, as it happened, I said right here, hitting 206. Now, you don't want to be greedy. Don't take the short, but short's a pure technical trade here. Back to the downside, and then obviously you rejected, went back down. So, that was just a awesome like technical trade. Like, not got to flex a little bit occasionally, right? Got to flex a little bit, right? But that was a great trade. But anyways, if Apple starts getting back below 199.6 again, your 2023 highs, I'm pretty weak on Apple. So again, to get below that, I'd be looking for pain there as well. Okay. Now, again, strongest names out there, Netflix is still a beast. It's still a clear monster. You're still sitting at 1250. If the market bounces back at all, NASDAQ finds buyers, Netflix is going to continue to run. Simple as that. Keep it on your watch list. Met has been another really strong name that I've been watching, me and Jordan have been talking a lot about. Um, I think this is still one of the best overall names out there. What I would love to see is this hold above 685. If you can't do that, you're going to be in pain. You want to see the bounce, a good reaction off that as well. You stay below 685, you don't really want to go heavy on it. You want to wait. Um 675 is a support. You lose that, you're probably coming back down to 660. 668 target number one. Kind of the range I'd be looking at there as well. Okay. Um a step further as well. Nvidia still looks fine, but you're below 141. Below that, I don't love it to the upside. I'd be looking for downside into 136 from here if you continue to find selling. Not necessarily a strong name. Microsoft has been one of the strongest names in the market. I would still respect it as such. You've made new all-time highs here in the day above 468.2. It's a long price discovery. That's what we're looking at. You may not get crazy volatility, but again, you have to respect it when it's in price discovery and where it's at right now. Very overall strong strong name. Um, AVGO again, if you stay above 2521.7, it's a long for me. Um, I still think it's going to be a strong reaction. A good idea of what Avid Joe could possibly do. I don't want to say it's going to do exactly the same movement, but it reminds me of Crowdstrike, right? Crowd ran really good into earnings into 490, almost 500, dipped after earnings. Earnings weren't really that bad. So, what happened there on Crowd Strike, right? You stay above your kilo of 456, you traded to the upside like three times. You're still sitting there, right? So, AVGO if it stays above 252, same overall type of trade. How I look to attack that as well. Those are my top overall names right now. That's what I'm looking at. If you have any questions, let me know down below. But overall, that's how I'm looking at the market. Made a short video here on the day. Twitter link is down below. All that stuff. I'll have more updates coming out on Twitter, Tik Tok, whatever it may be. Have a good one, traders. See you tomorrow."
