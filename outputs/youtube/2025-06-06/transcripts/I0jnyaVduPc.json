  "title": "LIVE: Euro Trade with Deeyana (6/5/25)",
  "transcript": "Welcome to the Euro trade everybody. It is Thursday and uh I am in my robe because we are nearing the end of the week and I want to be super relaxed. Now it's NFP tomorrow. So usually ahead of NFP we do see a lot more rangebound movement across the board. Uh, gold has been one exception from that. Uh, but before we begin, if you're new here, welcome. My name is Marcus Stalker D aka Danna Angelo. I've been trading for 18 years, 13 years out of that. I've been trading for various prop firms as a commodities trader. So, I do trade DAX, but we don't have DAX just yet on Topstep, hoping that that will change at some point. And until it does, uh, we're gonna stick to copper, we're gonna stick to platinum, we're gonna stick to gold, and quite possibly maybe ARB at some point, uh, if maybe, just maybe, if we're trading somewhere close to settlement of NAX, which is usually during the main broadcasts. I am not a huge fan of people learning on NQ. If you've been trading for many years, fine, you can tackle that beast. But frankly, from what I've seen as a VIP coach, I don't think NQ is appropriate for most people. Unpopular opinion right now. The reason why is it's way too fast for uh for most people to get their head around and it messes with people's emotions a lot. I always say AnQ giveth and Ank taketh. While it's a very very fastm moving product, it's really like like coach Jay actually said it really well. He said it's like learning how to ride a bike on a Formula One track. So your brain is like all over the place. People are zooming past you and you just don't you don't know what's going on and you know everything is just happening at quite a lot of speed and it's causing anxiety. It's causing fear. It's causing FOMO. It causes a whole bunch of problems. And in reality, most of you who have been around for like a year or two, you you're starting to get a decent idea of how to trade, but because you've decided to go for one of the toughest products. It does zooies all the time. It has seizure- like inducing movement in traandle. You're actually not having much success. So, you're in this spin cycle of constantly getting a a combine, passing it, getting into an XFA, and blowing it up. Okay, that's not good. And this is why a part of my mission here is to make people realize that that you need to learn how to walk before you can run. Okay, cliche, but very, very true. So this is why I would probably stick to products that are a little easier. Even YM and RTY, they have smoother price movement. So that's something I would advise into the end of the week. Uh in particular, equities have been very rangebound, very rangebound. And if you don't have a rangebound strategy, that can actually hurt you a lot. Oh, let me do my full screen. Sorry, Bruno. Now, whatever you see here, uh, and here here, whether it's my live account or my, uh, you know, combines, I might take a trade, I might not. Depends whether we get an opportunity. Uh, one thing to know about me is that I tend to try and catch larger swings on the day if the opportunity is there. This is not the week for that. Okay, we can aim for maybe one to two RS on NFP weeks and even on FOMC weeks as well, especially if we have the the rate decision. But if you don't have a rangebound strategy, just know that there is a way to trade these sorts of days like we've seen yesterday, but with a little bit of a mindset shift. A very good uh person for range trading is our very own Dolby Time, Nick Dolby. And you know, Rost, we have a different way of looking at ranges. Just listen to what he says because and I think he's thinking about making a video about that. I think that would be a very good idea. The way I approach rangebound days is to look for evidence of pretty large candles on a 30 minute chart that just wick around and then you typically one of the big big signs that we might have a rangebound day is when the first 30 minutes of New York Stock Exchange opens with a very large move immediately and then it wicks all the way back down and then in the very next candle on a 30-inut chart it just goes straight through it. It's a It very rarely is that a sign of a trending day and yet it seduces people into thinking, \"Oh my god, we're going. Let's go.\" And then you get smacked on the face and then you're like, \"This is shit.\" And that that's when we typically see chat saying things like, \"This day is pants. I I'm quitting trading. This is horrible.\" But it's just down to a perception change. So, you need to diagnose the day properly before you decide what sort of a strategy you're going to do. I see Yousef um said, let me go back. I think he was going short [Music] gold. And yet to me short gold maybe if we get to either 3,400 and then we start to struggle or if we get to 3420 and we struggle. Those would be my two areas for possible shorts. But be careful. I tried shorting gold yesterday, but it was very late in the day. And actually, if I had been looking at it a little bit earlier, because I wasn't um I was being tortured by copper yesterday. But if I was looking at it, I would have seen the area between 403 and 405 give me what I was looking for. But I was a little bit late. And uh yeah, it just uh it just kind of started dropping in a range, but it was a very very small range. It's not how like I don't like to nitpick. I need a pretty decent sized cans or ranges in order to go, okay, we have, you know, 100 120 takes of a range. Let's try and position ourselves on the edges of those. Now, because it's NFP tomorrow, I am actually going to stop uh the live trading for the week. I mean, I don't know. Maybe if we get down to gold 3380, uh perhaps I might pop in, you know, a few micros in there, but I won't be going into the NFP expecting that we're suddenly going to get, you know, some massive movement one day before. It's a massive release. It's probably one of the main leading indicators uh economically that we can have and uh the everybody's waiting for it. So, keep in mind that as we go into today, yes, there can there can be these unwinding moves that happen, but for the most part, that is not the norm. Usually, everybody's just waiting and waiting and waiting. Everything's pretty dull and uh don't get caught up in that. G Whiz is saying uh long um long gold, be careful because let's map out this chart now. Just be careful because at 3400 we actually have a big big options level uh that might act as a stopping point. Now that's not the gamma wall which is better to for for like stopping moves. Um but the gamma wall is up at 320. So a long might be a good choice. It's just I don't like the proximity of this core resistance. I want to be away from those big market making areas that can put a halt to any moves. And why does that happen? It's because the gamma walls can act as a ceiling or as a floor depends on where they're located uh in relation to the current price. And it's a very very good orientation point right and I see some people [Music] are some people are going for NQ short really I don't know let let me I haven't actually looked at um haven't looked at NQ I've looked at decks because I trade that. Uh I looked at S&P YM, but yeah, let's have a look at NQ levels as well because they they're kind of similar to to ES just, you know, it tends to overshoot things a lot more frequently. So, let me just drag out the options from my trusted website, which is mentor Q. the only people who do commodities as well as equities. Okay, let's see. Let's see what sort of a situation do we have there. Yeah, you see, so ENQ is already overshot massively, but ES still has some space until that 6,000 level. So, I would look at the ENQ. Do I have NQ here? probably because it's an Eval. I don't pay for NQ and ES on my live. So I only pay for YM because you know why would I because I don't trade it. Um but YM I do trade sometimes. Um but yeah, so ENQ overshot the gamma wall and and yet ES still hasn't reached the 6,000 where its gamma wall is located. Now if you take ES and NQ as correlating products. So let's put ES on the left, NQ on the right. And then let's map out the gamma walls. So an um ES is 6,000. So let's go and then NQ is [Music] 2750. So effectively, let's also go up to a 30-minut chart so that we're not caught in the minutia of tiny moves. So effectively, these two levels, they're one and the same, but obviously ENQ overshot it. And contrary to popular belief, some people are like, \"Oh, ANQ is the leader.\" maybe during the earning season, but what I found is that more often than not, this would be a vast overshoot of whatever ES wants to do because it's a bigger product. It's a thicker product, thicker market, and uh it tends to be a little more stable. So if I were to look at these two as a correlated two correlated products, I would say that there's still some upside left in ENQ until ES reaches the gamma wall. At that point, maybe we can look for shorts in ENQ, but only if we actually stop before the 6,000 or maybe just overshoot it a little bit. But if the market makers go up to that area and then shoot through it, more longs. Okay, more longs. Why? Because we never stopped on the first try. And then if a meaningful candlestick uh time frame hangs above it, meaningful mean 15 uh meaning 15 and 30 minute charts, then you can look at a retest of the 6,000 and a further move up. So that is how I like to look at the market, how I like to diagnose the chart. Now some of the other um levels from the options activity called the gamma exposure levels. You can even have dex levels delta exposure but generally they are more orientation points that are weaker. If you want to find really solid trades, I would stick away from most uh levels from options apart from um the gamma walls put supports and only if there's nothing close by. Maybe you can go to GEX one to three. That's about it. So hopefully that um that clarifies things a little bit more. But yeah, NQ to me is just an an overzealous bunny that overshoots everything and then people are like, I do not understand what's happening. It's like because you need I always find whenever I teach people on NQ who are like, okay, we're two, three years down the line into your journey and they're like, I really want to go back to ENQ. And I'm like, okay, cool. You've taken loads of payouts. You've proven that you can hold on to accounts. We've dealt with your mental triggers. Now, if you want to go back to NQ, let's do it. Just keep in mind all the work that we've done so far. And um to me, that's a you know, that's a better way. You have some experience. And somebody's asking whether ES is safer to trade. There is nothing safe in trading. We're putting risk on. So, what is safe? You know, ES is a little less crazy, but if you want safety in trading, just know that that is not possible. We are risktakers by by nature and yet most people then spend all of their time trying to avoid risk and trying to avoid pain. So yeah, that's kind of a little outlook for the equities. But I'm not going to be trading equities right now, at least not until we get DAX. And DAX in a similar vein, we're going to look at the charts. So, I'm just going to go to my charts because obviously we don't have um we don't have DAX yet. Um let me see here it is. This was a trade that I took index yesterday again with some reliance on ES options levels as well. Um, but let's not focus on that right now. So, DAX is a little less crazy. Super smooth. Whoops. There we go. Super smooth. And where are its own sort of relevant levels that I'm basing actually on a conversion from ES? It works pretty well. So, it also overshot because during this time of day, DAX is actually pretty lively. So 24367 that is where its own call resistance and a gamble wall was. So now that we overshot that I would be careful of the further upside move until ES also reaches its own 6,000 level. But now this brings me another setup. We could possibly run a long either from this initial balance high which is located at 24,365. It could also go down to VWAP. Uh we open inside value pushed very heavily outside of it. And if we get a retest of anything within where's my rectangle? It's not there. Is it there? Am I being blind? I'm not being blind. It's not on the toolbar. Okay. So, if we get a retest of anything inside this zone, and I'll explain the third reference point there. I'm just going to make this a bit thicker. Here we go. So, three points of interest here. One is that core resistance, former core resistance, former gamma wall that was overshot. And then we have what? We have the 30 minute time frame hanging above it. So now upon a retest I would expect a little bit of wiggling around but ultimately it's uh it should be supportive. That would be hypothesis number one. However, because we also have VWAP from Gloex just underneath it at 24352. We also have the edge outer edge of the London session from yesterday which is hanging at 24338. I'm not just going to put in a trade. I would drop down to a low time frame keeping this zone in mind and then looking for a price action pattern that will tell me that we're rejecting. Now, usually I like to use two minutes for that. You can use range bars, you can use whatever you know you want. You can use tick charts, but that's how I would be approaching this. So, I know where my levels are. And you then drop down once you have that larger time frame context, you then drop down to a lower time frame and you scan for that bigger move that's supported by volume. So that's kind of the plan for DAX for me today. So I might be trading my personal account, but uh obviously I would love to trade DAX on top step someday. Someday we'll get there. What is a gamma wall? Um, gamma wall is a concept from um the options activity um where how would I put this in a simplest way? It basically is a point where it's a measure of how far a product might go um and how volatile the the price of the option is going to become for every um is it $1 or one point movement? I can't quite remember off the top of my head, but it's basically an area because it has so much interest. It is an area where market makers either have to hedge their positions. It means that they either have to offload some positions at that point or they maybe have to liquidate some shorts. So, it's not like, oh yeah, gamma walls will always stop the price. They will stop it most of the time, but if the conditions are right, they might act as accelerators as well. So, this is where context has to come in. You can't just go, \"Oh, yeah, it's a gamma wall. Let's just go short.\" If we've had a significant movement up to that area or down to a gamma wall, it increases the probability of the gamma wall being a reversal point. But I combine it with time of day. I combine it with value areas. I combine it with VWAP. I combine it with the outer edges of value. I combine it with, you know, ADR exhaustion points. They're my concepts, the quantitative extremes, which I take both from the active session and also from the overall 24hour day. So yeah, it's um you don't need to like bash your head too much to know exactly what what the the uh the area is and exact definitions of it. Just know that there's a high probability that the prices will go towards these levels because they act as magnets or they will act as accelerators for further upside or downside. Yeah, JD says D share your indicators please. It is my company full disclosure I run a software firm uh called blottic and um right now we are still working on the indicators for other platforms right now I'm still using my uh AMP futures Metatrader 5 which has a CQG connection where I can also see the bid and ask spread um through like little lines that are just there. It's very helpful especially for thinner products like copper. Um but yeah, my main three indicators that I have on my charts at all times um is the Blic MP uh not Michael but BLIC market profile blic supply and demand which gives me my zones on multiple time frames. So, let's go up to a 30-inut chart and you will see that it just shows me, okay, maybe DAX is not the best choice for this because it's uh at all-time highs, but let's maybe have a look at copper and uh you know, my charts and my design of my indicators was something that I needed as a trader. So here I can show you relevant. This is now showing me relevant uh boxes which is a supply and a demand on a 4hour chart. If I then go to another button, it's going to show me the daily demand and so on and so forth. Um I have my average ranges. The blue line indicates when the quantitative extreme for the current session will happen and the larger longer dash lines indicates when we're going to exhaust the quantitative extreme for the entire 24 hours. So literally at a glance I have all of this data without needing to do calculations or anything because I used to do it in a spread Excel spreadsheet and when I was able to I had somebody helping me uh to create all of these indicators. I'm very fortunate that all of our developers, it's only a small team, but the developers are all from large bracket banks and they all worked as like software architects and you know software people for very large investment banks. So the quality of them is amazing and we're kind of hoping to bring them to other platforms. Right now we're working on Ninja. Um depending on how things go with so the theme is a little bit um they they don't like trading view. They're like trading view pine script ew. But now with the API access where you can basically use whatever you want on the back end and just use the API access to connect uh into top stepex you know it might become possible for us to start maybe creating some of our flagship indicators so blic drmpp and blic supply and demand into u into spec. So maybe that will come. I'm I'm not going to say it's going to be tomorrow but give it a year or so. you know, it takes time to translate indicators into other platforms and um now that we can use like, you know, Visual Studio on the back end and just kind of pipe it into something else, it might be easier. I don't know. We'll see. Sean, we are working on on it. I can see your question. Is Barable 28? Not yet. But that is the current project that I've got going on in the background. So, yeah. Again, you you know that I'm a huge proponent of having other businesses and not being super stressed out. Like the stuff that I use payouts from from any kind of prop firms and I have done for a long long time is for trinkets, right? So this new computer that I'm streaming from uh it cost me probably about four let's say 4.3,000 pounds. So nearly like 5,000 that was from the payouts that I took. Um, and you know, I've actually decided to invest in a pretty good camera as well because I've I've got this camera. It's, you know, it's pretty nice. I've been using it for many years now, but I think I need to do a little upgrade and you know still think that um you know investing in in the lights and businesses and uh and uh pushing your your business life forward and bringing more quality to people. I think that's where my current u goals lie. to build out the studio so that it looks very very pretty. Now, for those of you who have a keen eye um like I'm not let me let me just put me in the in the whole big picture. So, if I move slightly, you will see in the shadows we've got Bob, the neon sign lurking. Now, Bob um is going to be probably somewhere in the middle of the room. Uh but for now he's just resting in the shadows, right? Being illuminated by a single lamp that is sitting on my saxophone case at the moment because I don't have a stand for it. And I don't want to mount it on the wall, I could do. Uh but it um yeah, it's kind of one of those things where the closer it is to the bright wall, it it it sort of just diffuses the light too much. So I think I'm going to have to put it somewhere. But yeah, that is coming. So, we're going to have Big Bob. Big Bob just waiting waiting in the background for for the puts and calls to arrive. Um, lighting. I'm actually pretty sorted. I have uh I have two uh Elgato lights and I also have the uh one big key light as well. Um, but I see people don't like the lights. Okay, we're going to try and do something. I do think that the lighting is more to do with the camera than anything else. Uh, however, I am a little bit yellow, so that's um it's just like my complexion, I suppose. Um, I am Mediterranean and I don't have a tan at the moment. So, all of us kind of go a little bit grayish and yellowish. Uh, so that that's probably not the lights. That's probably D cuz you know I have a lot of yellow undertones in in my in my uh in my skin tone just naturally. And my sister is exactly the same way. So, you know, so if you don't like it, you don't have to look at me. You can just listen. But yeah, I'm going to try and sort it out. Maybe get some blue lights or something to offset my yellow natural yellowess in the face. Yeah. Apparently, I look like Adam Warlock. Okay. What's wrong with that? I like that look. Yeah. You don't like I think that's a pretty cool look. Looking a bit golden. Trading gold. Looking golden. Yeah. Hikari is asking does Topstep have a real time deduction of balance when you request a payout request a payout only on the new dashboard which I don't have by the way I am not from the US and right now only US people have access to it but yeah in the new dashboard yes if you're on the old dashboard no there you go says definitely not the sun causing that light today It's a very miserable day outside. Um and um yeah, maybe you know, now that we're in the big house and stuff, we're still kind of settling in. Um at some point I might like do a tour of the house, like sort of like top step cribs. Uh it's a really really nice place. It's completely suitable for us. It's not massive. It's a very spacious single story, but no more stairs for me, which I'm very happy about. Dax is getting there. Yeah. Yeah, we'll see what happens there. Where am I located? Well, I'm not going to give you my exact location, but I will say that I am in Sari in England. I lived in London for 20 years, maybe even longer. Um, and then I just got sick and tired um of everything. Uh, topics is camera camera secondary. Yeah, I know quite a lot about cameras, but um the thing is again with my complexion, I tend to look yellow wherever I am. So, I would have to do some pretty heavy color correction to to get that because I am like, you know, you can't help your natural skin tone. It's like, what do you want me to say? Yeah. Every time I'm next to someone, you know, somebody takes a photo of of uh you know, either English people or, you know, any other sort of white person of not um not of a Mediterranean background, they all look kind of like a little bit rosy, you know, whatever. I always just look yellow. So, go figure. You know, I am a bit of a Mediterranean mix. So, we've got obviously I was born and raised in Serbia. I am uh Serbian, but I also have Italian, Greek, Turkish, and then if you go far back enough in our family, there's like some northern India in there mixed in. So yeah. Um Marquez is asking, \"How do you quantify home living space in Europe? Is it square feet or square meters?\" You know what? We are so messed up over here. We're supposed to be metric. We're supposed to be metric, but for some reason, all right, so DAX is getting a little bit of a movement. Uh, what I like to do with these levels, um, so let me go back to DAX at the moment. What I like to do with these levels is when we hit one of these core levels, and let's say I'm speculating a long, I actually like to use a 10-minute chart, which um, is not for some reason is not enabled in TOPS effects. Once we hit it, I wait for another 10 minutes and then if I have a reversal, especially in DAX, in DAX, like you don't have to rush because it is very smooth and it gives you that follow through. So you don't have to like mess around with very very low time frames, but I usually like to wait for about 10 minutes after we hit uh the uh the line just to make sure that the larger time frames are still sustaining above it. And if they're not, then I will look for a different setup or maybe to dip deeper into the zone. Um, DAX loves testing Gloex VWAP uh before it does anything else. But yeah, we'll see whether my little trading idea here. Again, I'm not itching to trade today because it's like whatever. It's NFP tomorrow, so I'm I'm um perfectly happy to wait until we shake everything out and then come back Monday. um don't really um fancy getting stuck because what could happen let's see what the time is so around about 10:30 11:00 which is in half an hour to an hour DAX has this annoying thing to rotate uh through whatever range it's established since the open uh so I'm mindful of that and this is why I want to give it a little bit more time on a little bit of a larger time frame to show me the reversal. And then how much space how much statistical space do I have? I have 173 points up to the average session high for London. That's a hell of a lot of space. You know, I'm kind of looking at maybe taking 70 to 100 points from it. So there's, you know, there's lots of space there. So, if it's a true upside move, I really am not rushing to get involved. But yeah, let's go back to gold actually because I have been u interested because I've noticed ah here you go. You see that core resistance? Let's go get rid of NQ. Yeah. So core resistance 400 just like I said. So now we wait. So again same rules apply. You hit the core resistance and then wait for 5 10 minutes and then see whether we hold below it. And then if you hold below it you can have a little bit more confidence that that short trade in gold which is very dangerous at this point. Uh you know it's very early in the day. We have a long long day ahead of us and um and I actually locked up my live account until my 3 pm because I want to trade it during comx. I think more opportunities are going to arrive. Really my plan for gold today is not shorts. But it's actually longs from 3380. So if we can get down there and I can find good contacts around that area, that would be my primary choice of entry. So longs, not fighting shorts. Maybe if we're like at the end of the day and I'm sitting at some really tight area um that I can lean on, maybe 34200, sorry, 3420 uh 3420 maybe into settlement, you know, last sort of half an hour or so of active trading, even though it continues to trade after. Maybe we can get a short from there. But this is too a too close to VWAP because you know we might be getting prepared to to lift off again. You know this is gold. It's been on a relentless uptrend. Those bad numbers yesterday that we had from uh the economic releases also didn't help matters. Let me have a look at the questions because I haven't been keeping. Sarah says uh finally pass 5x phase. I'm taking it slow and steady this time. Excellent. Um, remind me Sarah, have you taken any payouts before? Sarah says, \"I'm in Sar too neighbors.\" Yeah. So, I'm kind of on the edge of West Sussex and Sorry. Like, it's pretty pretty far down. Uh, again, not going to divulge exactly where I live, but um but yeah, it's a beautiful beautiful area. We have uh we have cows. They've just had coughs. Actually, I saw a little cough yesterday. I sent it to Coach Hoop and I mean for Coach Hoop is nothing new for him, you know, he's grown up on farms and stuff. He's in Arizona. Um, and I think he was in in uh Chicago before obviously, but uh but yeah, he's in Arizona now. So yeah, it's uh wrecked says sounding like my parents. No stairs. Yeah, you know, I have a I do have an illness. So that I every time I went up the stairs, I kind of felt like I lost an energy spoon. It really wasn't good for me. So yeah. So Sarah, have you taken payouts before? I think you have, right? Not with top step. Okay. Um yeah, then go for it. 5x just, you know, don't fall port. And um I suggest locking up your risk settings for the for glowbacks the previous night. So, you know, I don't know what time you go to bed and stuff, but if you stay awake or maybe you can just set an alarm and um and you can set it up so that you don't ever find yourself in a situation where the risk lockout is not there. It will definitely prevent disasters going forward, especially in those first stages of um of new exophase. Definitely. [Music] Um, okay. Uh, wrecked. Oh, hold on. Topex says, \"Do do you look at open interest in options while trading futures?\" I look at open interest um only end of day and only if we're like some very big inflection points as Hog would like to say. And actually I use Hog as my indicator like if uh because he I know he tracks it for some of the the products that um like for example he tracks gold because I know that he trades gold. Um he tracks crude oil obviously ES and stuff but if I'm looking at open interest I only want to look at it like let's say if we've come up to a swing extreme and I'm like okay well what's the open interest doing? that gets a little bit shady around the rollover time. Now, copper and platinum, I do believe they will be rolling over at the end of this month. It's going to be the I think it's the final fourth Friday of the month. That's when they usually roll, but they frequently uh skip over a month or two, right? Gold is skipped a whole bunch. and that's to do with the demand for the delivery or needs of the producers and users of the commodities. So that's why that happens. Um so I don't look at it religiously. It's not like oh my god let's see what open interest is doing every single day as a part of my plan. But every so often I'm like okay we're up at the top. What is the open interest doing? Are we losing people or are we adding? But it's not, you know, it's not like Rex has a good question. I was watching uh some of Aaron Trades videos earlier and he mentioned only taking one contract and aiming for only 1.5 to two R for consistency. What are your thoughts on that plan? So I am in favor of that plan, but it's context. If we're in rangebound markets now, he trades gold. Gold has been bonkers, right? It has a huge range. So, it's not that hard to find a an opportunity in gold within a 300 tick range when we're supposed to be in quiet markets in a quiet market. That's considered quiet these days for gold. Um to go like let's say even for 50 60 ticks stop loss to get about 120 to 200 because it's still within that range, right? It's still within the average session range. If I look at it, look at the ranges on the daily chart. So, not just using the session range as an example, we're working with 561 ticks of average daily range. So, that's full 24 hours over the last 10 to 14 days. So, if you only wanted to find like, you know, 50 tick stop, 100 ticks profit within that range, that's very possible. But then let's look at something like crude oil for example. Let's look at crude oil. And I'm going to use my charts here just for efficiency and speed. Yesterday was a tape bomb day. But let's go to NAX. All the other days. What is the average session range for NAX? 121. What is the average daily range, 167? So, you only have 167 points to play with. Now, to me, that's below my requested absolute minimum of 180, but really over 200 is where I want to get involved. It's kind of like the same as seall. It tells you the volatility of the product in a different way. So, so when you have a day that looks like this, this is why I don't like crude oil anymore. It drops during the initial balance, drops down 128 points. First of all, that is already overshooting the average session range. So, that's already an outlier day. So then you're going, okay, and here is how I got in trouble last year with crude oil because I got used to crude oil having three to 400 tick ranges during the session. Not during the the whole range, just during the session, not the whole day. And then you would be going, okay, well, all right, I'm going to try three micros long and um going to use 55 ticks here for a stop and then I'm going to do two R. So Aaron says 1.5 to 2 R. Yeah, I agree with that. This is a potentially trending move. Now we uh smashing through the core resistance. I'm not doing this terribly uh accurately. It's just like, okay, we've gone over the core resistance. Didn't manage to um immediately hit it and bleed down through it. It's actually a full sort of 20 ticks above it. It's a decent sign that so far they haven't adjusted inventory to the downside. So, let's just run that. Um, DAX. I don't like that reversal in particular. I think that's going to start ranging. So, maybe another test of the gamma wall and then maybe I'll have something. Usually, I like to trade DAX from my 11:00. So, until that time comes, I'm not too bothered to um to jump into anything because that's my prime time, 11 a.m. to 1. So, that won't come for another 45 minutes. Uh yeah. So let's go back to this crude oil chart. So when crude oil was trading normally for the last 12 years as I've known it, it would do a failed auction which is what you see here extended downwards a little bit. Like if I go back in time, you will see that we also hit the average session range low right around there. So it's like okay, we exhausted the range. What is the next logical step? Um, the next logical step is that we go back into the initial balance and then rotate significantly back where it came from. That's how crude oil used to be. But here's what it's been doing for the last year. One big move. And I don't know, you probably have to be like, okay, on this day, this wasn't that difficult to read because we hit ADR high and then reversed. But on most other days, if you don't have any kind of reference, it's very very difficult to figure out what um crude oil will do in the first several minutes. And then if you do catch something, that's great. But again, if you if I go back even further, this is the kind of stuff you can expect from the initial bounce. Up, down, up, down, up, down. like one of my um Australian traders says, he's actually a coach like up and down like the horse draw. It's a very uh very interesting way of describing price action, but very accurate as well. And here is the problem. So, I like to base my decisions on the 30-minut chart. Why? Because before crude oil was very conducive to that. It was beautiful. It's like you just find a trade on a larger time frame and you run it for about 70 to 120 ticks. Easily done within a range of about 400 ticks, right? Not so easy in this sort of price action because it gets stuck in a range. This is 30 minute candles. This is two hours. So I'm like, okay, I can nitpick and lose my eyes. And frankly at almost 45, I really don't fancy doing that anymore. I want trades that are obvious. I want trades that are slower, decisive, and go into a particular direction with some follow through. Whatever that setup is, whether it's a breakout or a mean reversion or a failed auction, value acceptance, whatever shape those trades take, I want to see follow-through. I don't want two hours of nothingness. But this is probably scalpers paradise. It's like it goes up, it goes down, it goes up, it goes down. It's like brilliant. That's not my style. I hate doing that. Like the only time I would do that is if the 30 minute chart, so the TPO profile extends to both sides and then we start chopping around. That's beautiful. I love that. That's rangebound trading on the larger time frame. So 30 minutes and then we're just basically working within about a 100 tick range. This range is barely 50 ticks. Okay? So, you have to be super accurate, super precise. You have to keep staring at like super low time frames. And you also have to wait endlessly wait sitting in front of the screen because you don't know when it's going to happen for the stop runs and reverse. Stop run and reverse, right? That is the name of the game for rangebound trading. Um so imagine me sitting here two hours not having anything no trades nothing. Finally it happens for the um I call this the postNY cut. So it basically happens effectively into the Euro close, right? But I got the setup I got the setup already showing up as a potential range in let's say D period, but I would have had to wait to establish a range. So it's like because you don't know it's a range. Like all you're seeing at that time, all you're seeing and you tell me whether this is easy or not. So let's make this bigger. Where are we? I've lost it now. Oh, here it is. Okay. So, imagine this is real time and all you're seeing is this. That's the price action you're seeing. So, I'm like, this is a failed auction, right? So I go long and yes we have VWAP but you know in this situation it's not that relevant and especially not on crude oil like most times it just bleeds through VWAP. Um but yeah, you kind of go this is a failed auction but then and knowing 12 years of data that failed auctions go full rotation then you get you get this and you're like oh excuse my language bollocks it's a it's a range. So then you go, so now you're down money. This is how trading gets frustrating, right? And then you're like, right, well, let me wait for stop run. Let me wait for a stop run and then maybe try and snipe it. And it finally comes. But it comes after you've already spent like nearly two hours of your life glued to the screen. What happens to our mental capital if we're continuously staring at a chart for two hours? It gets exhausted. So, at that point, you're more prone. Take a look at Neuro Wednesdays yesterday with Jerome. That's exactly what we were talking about. Mental exhaustion and how long you have until your glucose runs out of your brain and you start making crappy decisions because you are effectively exhausted mentally. You might not be tired physically, but mentally there is no more fuel. And unless you go away and reset your body and your brain, it's not coming back. So to me, that's not a good way to trade, right? And that's what crude oil looks like on most days now. It's extremely frustrating. So this is why I moved away from it. I'm like, well, I I'm not interested in this. Okay, so gold is making a very See what I mean? So this is what I mean about smoother movement. You find the opportunity and it just goes like 43 takes without drama like intracal this is not whipping back up and down up and down for by about 20 40 50 takes 100 takes up down zooies we're we are very young we're zooming zooming we're raving everything is crazy everything's off that's NASDAQ by the way gold is like we went above the core resistance wasn't paying close attention to it just end. So, it's like smooth price action. Any any intracandle movement for now, it's not that dramatic, right? It's there's no drama. It's like, yeah, we're going up. And it's not NASDAQ like we're going up, we're going down, we're going up, we're going down, we go all the way down and all the way up. Where are we going to end up? Nobody knows. Nobody knows. It's like, what kind of price action is that? This is horrible. How How can you trade that? It's horrible. But yeah uh Fran says can you explain what core resistance and gamble how do you calculate look at so I don't calculate myself I used to look at the option matrix myself and then try and figure out what's happening I have a fly that's joined joined here it's the only problem in the countryside you do tend to have ah missed it go Hey. Um, yeah. So, that's going to get annoying. Anyways, um I don't look at it myself. I used to um have to look at it myself because I always used options activity in some shape or form to guide my decisions. But there are brilliant companies now like Mentor Q. Um I'm happy to do like collaborations with them, but I'm not like an affiliate or anything like that. So, it's just a company that I really enjoy. Uh why? because they have simplified very very complex data down to like one line on the chart and that's all you need to know. So they have an academy as well you know it's all included in their membership. So basically whenever you are if you're interested in learning more um that's the place to be. Uh but I did explain a little bit about the gamma walls earlier in the session so I won't be repeating that now. Jake is asking, \"How do I get into your mentorship on top? I keep applying but don't seem to hear anything back.\" So, they do um drafts, right? They do a random draft. Um I have no control over that. Um now, that's a group mentorship obviously. So, we have each uh 50 people, so 50 traders for each coach. There are 10 teams. Technically, it's kind of a competition, but we are not really in competition with each other. Everybody behind the scenes, we are all, you know, pretty good friends. And there's no, you know, oh, hey, yeah, I'm going to beat you. And like, there's none of that. We're just all just trainers trying to do our best and uh wanting to change uh change other people's ways if they're struggling. Obviously, if you're not struggling, then you don't need us, right? That's uh not useful. But if you are struggling, whoever you end up with, it's um if you manage to get into a VIP, it's going to be quite a transformative experience. Now, yeah, I do have my personal coaching as well. I'm very very selective who I take on. Uh usually I look at the background of the person. Typically, people who do very well are engineers, doctors, um former athletes with some university, former musicians also with university. Why? because of the formatting of the plans and stuff. I don't want to spend a million years explaining people how to format something. Um, so I'm very selective and I also ask that the person has over ideally two to three years of active trading experience as in like trying actively struggling and you know and then I go through a whole interview before I decide whether to take them on. Uh, but for group coaching is different, right? It is a pretty random draft. Um, you do fill out as many forms as as you can, which increases your probabilities of getting into the VIP, but even if you just filled out one, uh, you will still be in the running to potentially be chosen for the VIP. But I don't think you can choose your coach, um, maybe not yet. I don't know. Uh, and I don't think you should. I think all the coaches are amazing. Like literally, everybody is so experienced. you know, we are all on the same page with our teaching. I said it yesterday with uh with Anna Marie when we were together for lunchbox trading. You know, none of us are saying anything radically different. Like we all have slightly different styles, but we're all here to come up with an approach that is statistically viable and to help you get there as well. As simple as that. So yeah, just uh keep an eye out if you if you filled out, you know, those forms, then at some point they will be announcing the winners of the draft, and it's just how it's done right now. I don't know, maybe in the in the in the future. I I really don't look, I'm just, you know, I'm just an on air personality, so you know, they ask us, do you want to do this? And I'm like, yeah, that'll be awesome. Or, no, thank you. You know, that's kind of where uh things end with with those of us who are more contractors. Um but with um you know with the VIP stuff it's uh it it might be like I don't again I don't know what they're planning right I don't just to put that out there but I I wouldn't be opposed to like for example people wanting mentorship from this person or that person and then maybe we can have some kind of a you know paid for service for the VIP like you know it's beyond me that that you you know, Michael is going um so far out to to offer this for free for for traders. It's it's beyond me. It's like he's so driven. He's so generous. He is so he's a big big visionary, right? And that is what I respect about Michael Patak endlessly, right? This is why one of the big reasons why I'm with Topep. It's big reason why, you know, I have Hogue there. There's Eddie. You know, I've known both of them for a very very long time. Um, and it is definitely a family, but it would be nice if we maybe expand that family to people who maybe want to pick their coach. I mean, I don't know. I really don't know. So, I'm just just kind of playing with ideas here, right? Uh, D, do you still use Edgeful? If yes, what are the benefits? Well, the benefits are that you don't need to code and you don't need to create your accounting algorithms. All right, we're so close to this target now that I'm not going to nitpick, but I'm actually going to take profit there. There we go. That's one trade done. This is kind of uh unusual for this time of day. So, I And it feels newsy. It went my way, but it does feel newsy. What is What does newsy mean? It means there was some sort of news release or tape bomb. Yeah. So, we had your zone PPI. Okay, that's great. just fly. It's like you decided to join the stream. You want to co-host, mate? Come over. Yeah. Don't be shy. You just literally just decided to join me. I have a buddy. I have a buddy. Should we name the fly? I had the window open earlier and obviously I live in the country. So, yeah. So, Edgeful. Yeah. It's um it's very good for for let's say uh how many times the initial balance breaks uh to one side, how many times it breaks to both sides, what is the average extension of that initial balance and then you can you can put it in a bucket of like per day. So on a Thursday, how does gold, for example, uh break the initial balance? I'm still with them. Um you know, I'm I'm still a member. Do I use it every day? know because most of the stats I do know. Uh, one thing I'm not happy about is that Andre I think um removed the TPO value gap because I I used to use that a lot and then they do like did like a uh overhaul and it seems to be lost now. So maybe I need to go um TPO value by session please. So maybe I need to sit on a on a call with them again. Dar is is educating me now because you know I was a city girl all of my life. This is the first time I I've my third time seeing cows alive. And uh he's saying you will have the privilege of horse flies this summer in the country. Horrible things. Are they different than normal flies? I haven't seen them yet. The thing is, excuse me, this um house is at a on a massive estate that has some like big historical tutor connections like political and stuff. So, it's a very massive It's not like some dingy little farm. It's an estate of like 2,000 acres. It actually encompasses not just one county, but two. It's enormous. And we're kind of at the edge of it. And technically technically by me buying this house, there is a clause that if um if there's any work that needs to be done on the pathway leading up to the farm, we might be liable for that. But um I don't think that anyone knows that because this estate has been here for the for like literally hund hundreds of years. This is why, you know, tutor connections and all of that drama and stuff. Uh but um but yeah. It's a very well-maintained estate and um because um you know I don't smell the cows, they seem to be quite trim cows. You know, usually cows are a little bit fatty and chunky chunky girls. Uh but now they are um you know all of them are pretty slim. And there was a new calf running around with his mommy there. It was ultra cute. Uh, and I showed hoop. I was like, \"Look, we've got we've got calves. We've got calves.\" And the mom was like pushing it. I I actually post that on my Twitter. You can find that. Uh, you can find my Twitter below this or X Twix how the way Eddie says it. But yeah, let's go on to the next question. So, trading 23 hours a day is not advised. I think I have an addiction to trading and always wanting to be in the market. Yeah. Yeah. it uh it's it's um so trading is not gambling, but like Jerome D says, it can lead to gambling behaviors. I fully agree with that. We're not supposed to be in the market 23 hours a day. If you're running a swing, that's different because you're not being active. You are finding an opportunity and squeezing the hell out of it as much as the day will give you. Entirely different. I do that as well. My average trade times average trade time is between like obviously it varies but it's between 82 minutes to 100 minutes which means on average I hold my trades for at least an hour and a half but I've had trades that I've held for 5 hours 6 hours 7 hours easy. That's different. However, if you're sitting there for the entirety of your day, 12 hours, 16 hours, doing trade after trade after trade after trade, that first of all, you're going to burn out. Like, dude, there's no doubt. I don't know how old you are. Don't need to know either. You don't have to like, you know, put yourself out there. But I will tell you, if you're younger, that can just about work. The older you get, remember, I've been doing this for nearly two decades now. The older you get, the more difficult it gets to uh to sit there and just smash straight. I'm just going to clear my throat. My little co-host is at it again. It's like, \"Hello.\" Like, every so often it just flies in front of my face. Probably because of the light. But yeah. Yeah. You want to join? What should we name the fly? What should we name the fly? It needs a name. Um Jar says, \"You try to shake them off. The horse flies. You try to shake them off your arm and they just cling on and bite you.\" Oh boy. That's That would be great. Yeah. I don't think I've ever been bitten by like many things. Maybe a you know a spider a couple times but uh yeah how long did it take me to become profitable? Um because I had the guidance literally from the moment that I started trading by a friend who who put me onto the trading side and he was already working for first he worked for an investment bank uh and then he went in for a small hedge fund. It was one of those like two guys in a Mayfair office kind of thing. But then he went back into the city uh to trade for a prop firm because he didn't really like the whole corporate side of it. But he came away from his experience with how they look at the markets. And the first thing he told me about is the trade location. It's um the risk control, stop runs, and how to place a stop-loss and never use more than x amount of um Seth Brundlefly. I like that. Yeah, that was actually one of my one of my favorite movies when I was little. Yeah, Seth. So, we have Seth joining us today. And and now for those of you who have joined me just now, they'll be like, who the f is Seth? It's a fly that decided to join the stream this morning. So, it keeps buzzing around on the main key line. Like, this is nice and warm. This is nice and warm. Hello. Hello. It's like Yeah. Hello, Seth. How you doing today? Yeah. Pretty good. Yeah. So, um I didn't have any kind of moments of, wow, I'm wildly unprofitable for two years. In fact, um, when I first started, and again, my friend told me, don't put money into life because I did that when I first thought of trading, I was like, maybe I should invest in some stocks. And it was 2007. And I put in like a small amount. It was like 400 pounds or something. And I put all of it on Intel long. Now, little did I know had I just held on to that through like the credit cards and stuff, um I would have done really well out of that. But what happened is that the first week it went up massively in my favor. It went up to like 10 times. It went up to like four like 4,000. I was like, \"Wow.\" And I thought to myself, \"This is very easy. I don't know why people think that trading, you know.\" And then the next day it went back on me. Of course, I didn't have a stop loss. Didn't even know what that was. and I lost the 4K and the 400. So then I thought to myself, maybe this is not for me. So I kind of didn't go back there until my friend was like, \"Oh, you're trying trading. I reckon you'll be really good at that.\" And I'm like, \"Well, from the my first experience, I suck at it.\" And he said, \"Yeah, it's because you you don't you don't know.\" I said, \"Look, I'm not into math. I was terrible student. Uh not for that.\" like I was generally a pretty excellent student, but math for some reason if it's pure numbers with no uh like application to them, I'm just my brain just kind of checks out. But when it's applied math, like physics and stuff, I loved that part. Absolutely loved it. So, I was actually pretty decent at physics, not like an A+ or anything, but I was a B+ student in physics and yet in maths, I was the equivalent of F. I actually nearly failed my last year um in elementary school because of math and I had to do like an additional exam and then they just gave us arithmetic and I smashed it. So my math teacher was like I'm going to kill you and I was like why? Well, I've been watching you just like be completely sucky at math for for like four or five years and now you do this. you do this like when push comes to shove you you're I can't give you an A. I can't this is a you know what do you call it like a supplemental exam because according to the laws in Belgrade back then you couldn't um fail the last year of elementary school it was against the reg like it was just like deemed that you cannot fail the last year you can fail fail any other year but not that one and uh I mean the laws have changed I went to school like a you know million years ago uh so you know we're talking like 1994 four here, you know, long long time. Um, very different than now. So, I knew that I'm okay with with just like, you know, calculations and stuff. And in fact, I'm I'm I'm excellent, but geometry got me, you know, some of the other parts that you have to do with maths just totally derailed me. I wasn't interested in it, and I was bad. like geometry to this day I can and the weird thing is in 3D space I can make things pretty well. I'm actually really good at that. So like sculpting I've tried that pretty good. So there's something about the 2D space that does not compute with me. I don't know what it is but yeah Tetris good. anything 2D and yet you're trying to create shapes and stuff, it just way over my head. But when it came to profitability, I had profitability straight from the beginning. So I went into a demo account. I totally considered it live. You know, at that point, I had no psychological traumas as a trader. If only uh somebody had told me what was to come. But basically, I did really well. uh spent about three four months on a demo. Um and I thought to myself, well, I mean, this seems pretty straightforward. You know, you let go of the trades that didn't work. You look for the larger opportunities. Now, the guy taught me swing trading. He didn't teach me intraday, just to make that perfectly clear. But then I started in life with a 2,000 pound um like very small pot like what basically what we start with on these. And in the first n months, I actually ran that up to £70,000. At that point, the the uh currency exchange between dollars and pounds was insane. It was almost two bucks uh per one pound. So basically that was like 140k in the space of nine months. I I think that was too quick for such a novice trader. Why? because then I got overconfident, over biased and I was like I am the wizard. I need to get a wizard hat uh for the moments when I still experience that I am the wizard because I still have those moments. Uh but I'm better at managing myself because what happened then is that I managed to blow up the entire 70k in the space of a week. I got biased, kept moving stops, removing stop in the end and trading things that I've never traded before. So I spent uh you know those nine months trading Euro dollar exclusively and then it was like gone but luckily it was just profits like you know net net in my head you know it is a 70k loss from back then but really real money it was only 2k because that's what I put in but it was the work and the time you know it's always the work and the time that goes into it that hurts more than the money itself and that's what got me on the path to to learn about neuroscience to learn about how we actually do things uh uh in our brains and why we tend to uh be so stubborn I suppose and then I discovered there's a fight or flight response then I tried to learn as much as possible about adrenaline response in the body glycogen reserves how we can control that better what fuels the fight or flight how do we make sure make sure that that doesn't happen and That's when I started going to the gym. Went a little bit overboard with that because I was supposed to go to the gym just to control my emotions, right? But actually, I started going to the gym as if I'm only ever going to compete as a bikini fitness professional in my life. So I I did like 10 competitions in the space of I don't know a year at one point but I started lifting few years beforehand. Really loved it and then arguably pushed it a bit too far but you know it was it was a big big part of my life for a long time. Um and then I got into prop trading in 2013. So by then I had generated probably about what was that in dollars. So, I'm just trying to do all the conversions. So, I had about 220k uh in pounds, which was a rough equivalent of just under a half a million dollars. So, I thought to myself, I'm pretty good at this thing, even though I messed it up at the beginning of my journey, but we're five years down the line. And um yeah, I think I can do this. I think I can do this. Let's go and do this professionally. Also, I wanted to learn how to do intraday trading because Euro dollar around that time was kind of going through crude what crude oil went last year uh it died it died on me and I knew that my skills needed to grow. So I tried for about a year to kind of crack intraday trading and I got nowhere. So I was like I can't do this alone and I think having the VIP program now as a part of Topstep where you don't have to go to another country and you know learn stuff. Um, I think that's a good thing and you can do it from the comfort of your own home while leveling up your skills and the entry point for you guys in the VIP is going to be free, right? You don't pay anything. Whereas I had to pay um a lot of money like it was like 25k to get into the apprenticeship and then after that it was like, okay, you get a funded account um but you still have to pay desk fees that are like 3K a month. And JD said yesterday that Jack uh Pelzer, our own own Jack, he had it the worst out of everybody. Uh he his desk fee was like 8 to 10K, but he worked for one of the biggest um um biggest firms in Chicago. You know, the one that I went to, it was it was uh I mean it was big, but they were they were not like massive. And I think they were kind of bit dodgy because I I heard uh while I was there there was like some I don't know what it is with certain prop firms. It's always like lawsuits and regulation issues and people doing their stuff and then suing them and you know that was the case back then as well. So it's a little bit of a kind of cowboy side of trading. It's like yes you're in banking but you're you're a prop trader. It's like okay. And to me that actually resonated because I was a musician. I had, you know, huge uh purple red hair, you know, had pink hair at one point and I didn't necessarily want to be a part of the corporate world, like do or die. In fact, when I went to work for an asset management firm, the first thing that they told me is that I need to get rid of the hair color. It's against the dress code. And I was like, \"Oh, this sounds like fun. Brilliant.\" So, yeah, it didn't take me long to become profitable. I was profitable from the very beginning, apart from a few blips along the way, but it's all because I got put on the right path, so to speak. So, so yeah. Uh, topex says, \"Your teacher was the issue, not you.\" I have assure you that the teacher was not the issue. I am I was so into music that nothing else interested me. like I only like I was obsessed with music and from the moment that I woke up I was either singing or playing instruments or driving my mother up the wall and it was just like trust me people tried right they would so this is let me explain to you how I was with math they would be like okay here is an equation with two unknowns and I don't know blahy blah and then I kind of look at it and I go, \"God, snore. Here we go again. Two greater than two unknowns. Brilliant.\" And and then I would be writing it down and I would write it down wrong. I would put like three instead of eight or like four instead of one. Now, I'm a left-handed person, so granted my, you know, my handwriting is always been absolutely horrendous. So maybe that had something to do with it. But it was the sheer disinterest on my part. You start talking to me about numbers and you know what was the worst? A geometry and another thing textual logical assignments. Oh my god. I'm a visual person, not like somebody who can just listen and take in information. I don't do audio books because I need visual in front of me. I need something to that like I'm reading, I'm seeing, and it's it's it's presented to me in a visual fashion. No, they're like, \"If trainer A goes to train, if you want to torture me, that is what you do. You give me a effing textual logical problem in textual form.\" I glaze over immediately as soon as I hear if you do this and you do that and what D is out like she checked out. She's over in, you know, over in Leyon visiting Jerome and Bruno. She's not here, right? That's a very difficult thing to tackle. It wasn't the teacher, I promise you. It was me. My mom even got me like private tutors did not work. But when push came to shop, I was like, \"Holy crap, I'm going to fail. Uh I I need to make this work.\" I put all of my focus into it and guess what? It worked. So yeah, but to me trading is more equal to music, note sheet, pattern matching. Um, and you know, turned out that I love data. I love science in that regard. Applied maths, right? Applied maths. But yeah, profitability wise, um, I'm probably one of the few people that had the right guidance from the start. And I'm not saying it's linear. I go through draw downs. It's just a normal fact of life. So it's like you go through a draw down period, then you're smashing it, then you get another draw down period, then you're smashing it. It's just a cycle that we live in as traders, and that has to become your new norm. You have to get comfortable in draw downs and just go, hey, it's just how it is. Market's not playing ball, but you know, at this point for me, I know why. That's the difference. Whereas when a novice, more novice trader gets into John, it's like, what is going on? What's happening? Like for example, I had somebody in the VIP who got into a bit of draw down during the high volatility and he was like, \"I'm just not going to trade now.\" And I was like, \"What do you mean you're not going to trade? We have amazing movement, man. It's like this is what we live for.\" And um they went, \"Yeah, but I'm always using um 10 point stop and now I can't because I just I can't survive a trade for longer than a nancond.\" I said, \"Yeah, but that's not the reason not to trade. that's the reason to adjust to stop to the volatility of the market and also adjust the position size accordingly. And he said, \"But yeah, but I've always used 10. How long have you been trading? Five years.\" Yeah. So, you've not actually been through Oh, I don't know. It was like three years or something. Uh so, someone was like, you can't use the same size stop loss through different market conditions. Okay. There are times where you can use super tiny stop losses of like three points in ES or one point in ES. Back in the day, that was like not impossible. Why? Because it would only move four ticks for the entire day. So, you would still be doing the 4 to one adjustment on the stop loss versus the range that you're working with. And u it's like, yeah, man. It's like, of course, you need to adjust the stops to the volatility of the product. And then they went, \"But I'm just going to stop until it blows over.\" And I said, \"Dude, what if this is the new norm like it was during COVID?\" Because we got a kick up in volatility, then marketly changed ES and ENQ. Because before then, we had like ENQ trading at a 75 maybe 100 point range per day. And then COVID came and the ranges came back into equities and never came never went away. Right now we get a reduction that kind of looks a little bit like um like the dry up of liquidity. We have summertime coming and whatever. Last two summers we were very uh fortunate to still have very lively summers. That's not the norm. You know we had the election year and then the previous year I don't know we also had something but it was more lively than normal but actually the outlier is uh the movement during the summer. Usually you get a huge dry up of everything across the board. Gold less. So it's probably the only product that still keeps moving during the summertime with some range. But everything else across the board, it just dies since half halfway through July all the way sometimes through to like second week of September because that's when the big boys are away, right? So nobody's in the room, nobody's trading and it's all just like random walk and it's just like like really dull days. Um there's a way to make make money but yeah um so so yeah whenever you are talking about profitability talking about trading um there will always be adjustments so it's never um uh okay here's the next question did I read that does it ever get easier to trade psychology wise yes because you get to know yourself you get to know your mental al triggers you get to know. Um actually let me k out engineer let me just wind down your question with the following. Was I profitable from the start? Yes. Was I consistently profitable which is a completely different point. Was I consistently profitable? Yes and no. There was like a lot of mishaps along the way. It was never a linear process. It took me nine years, nine years before I was like, okay, now I don't have massive fups and it's generally quite consistent and in a very smooth curve generally. Yes, there's draw downs, but it's not like one day up 60k down uh 50k, the other up another 15k. I don't have that. Like all of my wins and all of my losses are not super dramatic. They're like kind of within, you know, 1.1K up to 3K. But 3K would be like a day where I'm like, right, well, I've got some money, you know, from whatever the buffer or, you know, the account balance and I'm like, and today I really think that this is going to go. But then you get to a certain point, like yesterday, I got to minus 1.6K and I'm like, look, I I haven't tried all day and it's just let's just give it up. And once you get to that point of surrender, surrender mode. Now, I don't have all of my lovely um uh lovely funny cartoons that I like to put down uh because they're on my old computer and I haven't transferred it all yet. Um so, there is this excellent funny cartoon where the lion finally catches up with the gazelle. And it's a it's an anime. It's um literally a cartoon. It's a illustration. And in that exhausted moment, the gazelle goes, \"Do you really want to ruin all that cardio with a snack?\" Like the the gazelle turns into a a wise ass, right? Into a um somebody who's cracking jokes. Why? Because they've surrendered. There's there's no more. And when you learn to get there before you blow up, that's a complete game changer for your mindset. Jerome yesterday talked about being uh imagining a room in the visualization where you walk in and you have basically buttons for different states. I imagined a mix desk with knobs where you can tune each one of them individually. So it's very hard to do. It's very hard to do, especially if you've never done any mindfulness or self-awareness and introspective work on yourself. But it's so helpful. You imagine each part of you like fear, FOMO, frustration, anger as little knob on the mix desk, right? And then you go urgency, right? All of them, whatever that might be for you. And then you go to the mix desk in your mind and you go, which one is lighting up crazily. Which one is it's like, okay, it's frustration. Let's tune it down. Let's tune that down. Tune it down. Obviously, use it work for you because I know that when I was really frustrated as a novice trader many moons ago, that wasn't enough. Breathing was not getting me there. My heart rate was still like up in my like my throat. Um, so what I did, I went to the gym to completely beat things out of me, just going. But, you know, I'm a very passionate person. I am a pretty nononsense person as well. Uh, have very thick skin for many things. And, uh, you know, I've been through wars, man. No troll that comes into here means absolutely nothing to me. They can troll all you like. Troll all you like. I don't care. It's like once you live through three civil wars by the time you're 20 years old, nothing effing scares you. Okay. Uh but yeah, each to their own. Obviously, we've all had very different lives. Um I probably have a higher emotional threshold for reactions than most people, which is helping me in trading, right? I don't freak out. Uh even when there's a big loss like that, there was one time um that I did get frustrated and that was the point where I lost a 70K. I cried in the corner. I actually remember back in the early days of Top Sip TV, Dakota said something really funny. He said, \"Are you really a traitor if you haven't hugged yourself and cried in the corner?\" At some point, it's like, it's so true. It's like in the beginning, you just don't know how to deal with all this like myriad of emotions. But it's down to keeping track of your mental triggers. It's like where what makes you go on tilt? What happened in price action that made you go on tilt? Not just, oh, I lost the trade. What was price action doing when you lost your your [ __ ] right? Uh, was it too fast? Was it too slow? Was it lack of direction? Was it direction completely in the wrong uh wrong way, but you kept going in with your original idea, expecting a fake out, but not waiting for price action? All of that, like drilling deep down into what your mental triggers are can help you so much. Um, let's move on. Wrect says, \"At what point did you scale up or do you trade the same size?\" So, I use the concept of 1% per trade. Now, I was a swing trader. So, that meant that I didn't trade every day. So, I traded maybe maybe once every two weeks. So, 1% per day, shooting for about five to seven% return on that one trade. I never went past that on my personal accounts. In fact, as the accounts grow uh as the accounts grew larger and larger over the years because, you know, obviously I made money as a prop trader as well, I actually reduced that. I reduced it down to 0.35% per position. In futures, the way we're doing prop uh right now, it's usually more aggressive. So, I do allow myself up to so between two to four% per position size. However, I don't do that in the beginning stages of any combines. Now, I have a live account, so any combine that I pass, I can't do squat with it, right? So, it's just going to sit there. So, I don't have a, you know, a need to be passing combines, I'm just going to use them as an educational tool or when I want to, for example, this week wait for NFP to shake out or I want to trade later in the day, but I still want to maybe pop in a couple of trades to kind of show some setups like this cold resistance smash and then a follow through. That's what we were doing here today. Um, but generally, um, I did not scale up until like I I made roughly, you know, if you kind of going to average it over 100k for the five years that I traded per year uh before I went into prop. So, you know, I don't know whether that means anything to you, but when I went into prop, the prop firm was scaling you at a different rate. So once I get got past the the apprenticeship, you it basically worked like this. So you get into a prop firm first month you're given one lot. Now the prop firm that I worked where I worked gave you a $20,000 monthly actually an overall loss limit. There was no daily loss limit at that particular prop firm. There was just like an overall limit. You could also trade overnight, but you had to run it with a third of the position size and then make sure that you're calculating like swaps and like all of the other stuff. It used to take me like an additional like half hour to to do all of that at the end of the day if I wanted to carry over a position. Over time, it just became easier if I became intraday completely, you know, whatever. Um but um the scaling up proper way was done by you being given the base amount then if you make uh let's say like in my first month I okay first week didn't go so well then they put me back on the sim but when I went back to live again I actually managed to make 25k in my first month um because I was there for already two months before I went back into live I had uh six grands worth of the fees to recoup for the desk fee and then I also like the way the profit split was happening you start from the lowest tier which was only 20% of the profits but the rest of it went towards my next month's risk allowance or most of it. Um, I got paid like 1,250 for that first month and I was like, \"Yeah, that's uh\" So I made 25K net to me, it's 1.2K. Brilliant. Uh, so yeah, that was a little bit disconcerting. It's probably the worst feeling ever. Worse than blowing up any account, thinking, \"Yes, I've made 25 grand. It's amazing.\" And then you get the actual net sum payout from a prop firm first month with all the fees and everything and you're like h okay then now what? So you know it it kind of like it just slashes your ego immediately. So you think you're the wizard, you're nothing, baby. So the next month they scale you up more. So the next month allowance will be five. So now you have five contracts to play with. if you do well the second month and it just so happened I made 60 grand on the second month and I remember these because I'm just you know it's very uh very finely etched into my head because it was my first prop trading job and uh and yeah I got a paid a little bit more but again most of it uh went towards the next risk allowance. It really wasn't until they bumped me up to the percentage payout of 40% in favor of the trader that I started seeing some serious cash coming in. Right. But it was a huge journey and you know by the end of it in order to generate 40k a month I had to trade like position sizes between 80 to 120 contracts per position. They were just pushing and pushing. It got really stressful at one point because I was just like man I I can't like there's easier easier ways to make this kind of money. And then I decided to leave and I went back to London and I tried finding a similar prop firm. And whilst I never found exactly similar prop firm with similar rules and stuff, they all of the London prop firms they had almost like a uh 220 hedge fund split. It was like it was really odd. Uh but anyways, it's um it was a journey, you know, big big journey, very different from what you guys are experiencing these days. And I think you guys have it easier. We weren't allowed to mess up. If you messed up, you would be out of the like out of the company. We've seen that happen so many times. Somebody comes in with collateral 25K. They lose the 25K, they're out. They literally go, you know, the risk manager comes, you know, the shoulder tab. Yeah. That's usually how it happened. Or in the recent times, you would get like a private message pop up and go, \"Can I see you in my my office?\" And then you would have the walk of shame going to the director's office and you would sit down and they would be like, \"Yeah, so yeah, you know, they would talk you through the the loss and they're like, you know, your collateral is gone.\" And we've even heard people going, um, can I add more money? And they would be just, no, sorry. No. And now you mess up because everybody's learning, right? And even even those people were learning, but the the the opportunities to try again were just not they were very expensive, very prohibitively expensive. And uh you would have to hop to another firm to try again. And then after a while, if you've been through enough of them, everybody's going to blacklist you. It's like, oh, that's that person that blows accounts all the time. It was very different. you know, you couldn't just blow up over and over and over and people keep coming back and coming back. It's like, \"Oh, yeah, it's great.\" It's not a good thing. So, yeah. So, scaling up to me it was um scaling up for me came in the form of prop from capital. uh I just traded my 1% per trade for many many years and you know I've actually gone down from that in my personal accounts uh to the point that one loss even though it's bigger than anything that we're doing on prop just doesn't hurt because why because the pain threshold of the account balance size versus the percentage of capital overall and it shouldn't hurt it shouldn't hurt it should maybe hurt a little on prop but not enough to go, \"Oh god, ouch, like I'm going to have to start again.\" That's not a good mindset. So, just keep that in mind. It's okay to scale up, but just make sure that you have at least 20k of buffer before you start scaling up to anything. I would say 20k is where maybe you can try running. It's difficult. I would actually advise you that you don't go over one mini until you're up at 30K. But that's me. I'm a bit riskaverse these days. So, you know, risk averse granity is just how it is. I'm not super riskaverse. Like, if you compare me to, you know, some of the the the other people who are generally only trading micros, you know, I once I get up to about, you know, 15 20k, I will stick to minis. It's only if I drop back down to 10K below 10K of balance I will go back to micros five micros and then if that keeps going down then I'm going to go down to three micros try and dig myself out. So you know I'm not that risk averse is still aggressive trading on prop but it's less so than what we anything that we see from some people on top of TV. So you know take it as you will. We're all different anyways. Tumors are good. uh is torturing me with um with uh the textual thing. So, I'm just going to glaze over that because we're at time as well. So, let's take one last um one last question. Very good question for zero sum cat. How do you not get stuck in that mental place where you can allow yourself 1.5k loss and be okay with it for a prolonged period? Here's the thing. I will not allow myself to have like 1.5k loss every day. And once I look if I have two days of loss limit on the bounce I will immediately reduce size. So you know I'm not going to wait until I bleed the account to death. Like two daily loss limits. I'm like okay need to size down now. So this is why Monday through Tuesday I actually ran a five micro copper during Asia because one of my swing setups actually came in and on five micros I managed to get 1.1k. So you don't need to trade large to generate serious amount of cash. You know 1,00 day dollar day is fine. But as soon as I start to notice like let's say and you know remember I know how to stop. I'm not going to be smashing the 3k daily loss limit every day. I don't do that right 3k loss like the way the most I ever have as a run of daily loss limits but my personal daily loss limits not the 3k. This is how it would go. I would push it on one day, wouldn't work. 3K minus 3K. The next day, if I have another data loss limit, that's likely not going to happen, but I will stop at like 1.8. Third day, if I still don't manage to read it properly, it's going to be 1.1K. I'm going to stop at that point. The next day, I will again lower my expectations down to 775 for the daily loss limit. So the more days that you go into a draw down, the more tight the tighter shackles you need to be putting on yourself to ensure that you stick to that, please lock up your wrist settings the day before Gloex open, right? Not on the day because I promise you if you don't lock up those risk settings, you will move the effing thing. You will go, I'm just gonna Yeah, I'm 700, but I'm just going to give myself another 200. Bam. Down 200. No, I'm just going to do another 200. famous last words. Right? So that those are some of my uh coping mechanism. I think the biggest losing streak that I've ever had in that manner, you know, diminishing daily losses as the draw downs keep happening was six days. I've never gone over six days of of losses. Okay. So that is the expectancy that I have if I get into a really bad rut. Most of the time the way it works for me it will be one uh one one good day then um minus 700 then plus 1.1 then uh minus 1k that's like when I'm in a bit of a rut and I'm like so to me it's more like up down up down up down um but it's never you know just a straight up daily loss is bonanza until the account is blown I'm one of those people that when I get into a draw down I lose money slower. Lose money slower. If you are losing money, lose it slower. Okay, I'm going to end it uh there for you guys. And uh I don't know if I got any dogs in here, but let's do Pete the process parrot for the end of the stream. So, Pete the process parrot is going to warn you to slow down. Okay, that's it for today. This has been the Euro trade. Thank you for joining me. I will be on lunchbox trading tomorrow, but nothing today. Um, and obviously it is the weekend now for me uh almost. So have a great weekend everyone. I will see you again on Monday for another episode of the Euro Trade. This has been the Euro Trade. I'm Marcus Dodd. Have a good rest of your day. Take care."
