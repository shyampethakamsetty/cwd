  "title": "Circle (CRCL) CFO on IPO, Stablecoin Business #shorts",
  "transcript": "We believe that money is and is always going to be a regulated space. And so to bring these new technologies, effectively internet technologies into the world of money, that is a marriage between technology and regulation. And so we have been at the forefront of being a well reggulated financial market infrastructure company as well as an internet platform company in this space. Looking forward all around the world there's an emerging regulatory consensus on how to run a well-issued stable coin and in broadcast that is the way circle runs its business and perhaps we've played a part in that we've certainly spent a lot of time with regulators around the world and now as we look to the United States we are heartened that this administration as we would be with any administration is doing the hard work to put in place appropriate federal level regulation for this industry"
