  "title": "MARKET MELTDOWN - TRUMP & ELON CRASH THE STOCK MARKET",
  "transcript": "Good afternoon everyone. It is Thursday, June 5th, 2025 and we've got some drama here. Elon and Trump going at it and shares of Tesla down 16% largest market cap loss in history and uh Trump being named in a certain file that I'm not even going to say the name of here because I don't want to get kicked off the internet. Um, but you guys can figure that out on your own. And we got a lot to talk about here. I'm going to try and get this covered as quickly as I can. We got to do the members live stream at 4:05 p.m. So, I'm trying to wrap this up quick, but we'll try to cover things here. Also, if you like me covering the content, please give me a thumbs up. It helps out the channel a lot. Come find me ontrades.com for swing trading alerts analysis and live day trading absolutely masterass uh in the trading room here this week and it's been a good one. We also have a sale uh for that on Monday. So, if you're looking to get in, that's when you might want to look at it. But anyway, um yeah, basically, um pretty good sell here. Some volatility obviously in Tesla that that is getting whacked here. And yeah, look at that big outside move here. Now, we'll see where this finds its footing. This did get 300 was um definitely a dealer level that we were looking at and um there is a little bit of blowout there. So that can be hedged down and we're we're slicing through that um you know those moving averages on the daily and the weekly and we're going to close below that green bar low unless we get a m you know a major reversal here. So maybe even 250 could be a level that could come into play tomorrow unless you know things start to calm down in the overnight. But you know these accusations here definitely kind of rattling the market. We talked about this too. Um I was like waiting for some sort of a shakeout this whole time and I think we may have the start of it now. We got non-farm payroll tomorrow. The question will be and this is one thing I noticed and you might have noticed it already but as soon as NQ started rolling over today and really Tesla being the big culprit for that the Russell started to pick up. So we are seeing we're still seeing heavy dispersion out there and that's going to determine whether or not this can break down or not. Technically like we talked about the shot clock for bears technically like tomorrow would be like the last day. Um, but we were kind of just in the camp. All right, it's too much time has gone by already um for them to do damage and a lot of a lot of uh time has been wasted. So, basically, you're going to need to have a crash on NFP tomorrow um in order to really get a bare a bare play going um you know, early into the next like I would say end of quarter. That said, um I've been looking for this type of a shakeout. I'm kind of hoping we can get one. If we look at the RTY and I was just talking about this um in the trade room, but I like this structure, right? I think if something does break out, if we have a strong jobs report for whatever reason, and by the way, the market's already prepped for weak jobs, right? We had weak we had a massive miss in ADP and we had um an uptick in jobless claims again this week. So market is prepped for that to a degree. So even if we miss, it's something the market's not thinking that can't happen. But if you know the number comes in strong, we get a, you know, one of our favorite uh Ponzi reports, right? That's going to affect the Russell the most. And the structure here is the best, right? As opposed to NQ. This is what I didn't like about it. And this is why I kept saying like don't be surprised there's a shakeout coming because like look at the it's like it's almost like rising wedge-ish, right? Rather than being like as bull as much of a bull flag. It was kind of bull flag until it started doing this here. Um, still churn is up, you know, nothing really terribly wrong. And the same thing with ES. Um, you did touch the 5850, but since then you kind of just haven't filled out some of this air. The Russell has. So, I think if there was, you know, to be a breakout here, um, you know, the uh, right tail, I I think the IWM has the best chance. It also could be the worst if we have really bad jobs or the market reacts poorly. Again, I think dispersion is in fact I know dispersion's out there. Um I can see it in the tape and it's probably going to keep us supported. But yeah, definitely a lot of drama here. Um they finally made it interesting. I'm like at this point here um just have some runners on like in with the day trades, but you know, it's like we caught the low Friday, caught the low Monday. We've been holding runners. We've been, you know, trading in and out of the range here, doing a really good job. And um at this point, it's like, dude, I don't even care if it breaks out at this point. Like this is just I mean like this is so ridiculous here. It's such a stubborn range and it's like a range within a range here too. I mean like when you look at um ES for instance it's like you got the look at this 5970 to 6,000 30 points stuck in that for a while and then in this larger range there that's inside of this larger range. So just really tight. I talked about this this morning too. We we figured volatility was coming. We have the non-formable report tomorrow anyway. But really, you know, the Ballinger bandwidth is really tight here on the 4 hour. So, we'll see if um we can unpin a little bit here and get a breakout or a breakdown uh one way or the other though. I would like to see some more structure here even from the from the bull side. Um but again, the fact that the Russell is not even making a lower low here is I think that's a sign of supportiveness. Um, so S&P little kind of faux like higher high divergent high there and the and the uh sorry the NASDAQ as well went all the way up to 530 and almost got to the 535. There was some put uh call sellers up there for today. Didn't quite get to that level and yeah kind of has like a little it's not the best but kind of a rising wedge type look. So you you know we we probably could uh fill this area out here a little more. And we talked about the Russell hasn't triggered that inverse head and shoulders but it's there. And the same thing with the Dow SMH here down 92 cents. Broadcom reporting earnings. Um 245 to 280. That's your range there. So uh that's not financial advice. Don't trade based off of that. But that that's where the expected range is. Lululemon, in case anybody was wondering, I think that can go to 350 if it gets if they you know have a good report. I think downside is like 320 and 300. Uh big tail upside would be 380. But anyway, IGV um really strong day until you know this end stuff going on here. Microsoft new all-time highs. So that helping out cloud. Um transports again were up nicely and then kind of dipped here. Tightening up here as well. Move is coming on that daily chart as well. And then the 2-year note down. So again, rate cut odds kind of just fluctuating back and forth here. So yields having a little bit of a day here. There's a 10-year bouncing back. XHP was strong uh after opening lower inside day there. Nothing terrible. VNQ tightening up that that looks good too. And then we had um banks again still inside of that tightening range there. So there there's volatility coming. This range is is really tight in a lot of these sectors. Broker dealer is tight as well. Another thing that's tight, I wrote an article about this too with oil and I talked about this yesterday, but look at one hit sell off almost made new lows and then a month later we finally hit the same area. Week later we hit the same area. One, two, three, four days in a row, we hit the same area and the dips here are are they're not dipping, right? You're not getting this reaction. So I think path of least resistance here is up on oil. And again, you can see here volatility is coming. It's it's coming now. So I think we're we're getting ready to to break out here. All right. Uh XLE that was all over the map today. Nothing really terrible. It's basically flat right now. So energy stocks not doing a ton. Um that gas quiet day as well. Dollar index was strong uh after a week open and dollar yen still holding up pretty well here. So not really looking to risk off. Uh gold down a little bit on the day but again still a nice pattern, nice structure there. Silver big winner on the day. New 52 week highs. New multi-deade highs actually. Yep. But it did come in off the high. So again you're not you're not you got to close above that. So, we'll see if it can do that. Again, we talked about this. I do like that SIL is leading though. That's a huge huge positive. Platinum huge move up 4.7. So, this dip by ended up working, but you know, I didn't take it. I wanted to see a little bit more structure because this has been a a rug puller for like a long time. But, yeah, big move there for PL and PA here. Um, kind of just underwhelming comparatively. Copper was up too. Did come off the highs though. So, pretty cool stuff. At least we got some, you know, at least the market woke up a little bit here. And um Bitcoin right now also backing off. So, I can't get my other chart up. Hold on. Sorry. I'll just use the futures here. Yeah. So, backing off here. Was hammering on that 106 area. Um, but it did come back in. So, we'll see where it closes the week. Yeah. And it was up seven in a row. So, it it is pulling back, but it's not like it's not like it's pulling back in a vicious manner. Going to see some acceleration to the downside today, though. We'll continue to watch that. But right now, 5950 is a big short-term level for bulls to reclaim on SPX. This is just kind of like a near-term level. We'll see if that can, you know, if it break a pack above that. We close above that, this will squeeze. So, we'll see where we get uh with non-farm payroll tomorrow, but we should get some volatility coming soon. Um, by that I don't necessarily mean volatility is in the VIX. I just mean like trend trendy type move. I'd like to see a little bit more of a shakeout though personally to build more structure here. I don't love how this just took off without kind of filling this this air out. I think if there is something that's going to break out though on favorable jobs, it's the Russell. That looks that's that structure is much tighter. So anyway, we'll see what we get and we'll see uh we get more reality TV in the internet. So anyways guys, I'll wrap it up here again. You guys take care. Come find me on confortrades.com. And I'll see you guys all tomorrow."
