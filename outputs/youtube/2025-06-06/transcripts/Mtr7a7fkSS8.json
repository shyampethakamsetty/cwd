  "transcript": "This is trader and this is midday trading. Now the old market uh the meltup continues but just remember as it melts up that never ends. Well eventually going to have a big correction here but remember ride the wave you stops until she ends. Okay. Now today we're going to take a look here at Tesla which is really not having that good of a day. For me it was because I did a short and a long and then we'll take a look here at race and then Goldman Sachs and then we'll take a look here at Amazon. This video is for information not recommendation to buy any stock ETF. Please like subscribe. Thanks for watching. All right, here we have Tesla your daily and your weekly chart. Now Tesla's been coming right on off here. Old Musk now he's uh kind of criticizing the OT man and I don't think that's working out too much instead of dumping the stock. However, when you look at the charts here, look where it came right down to the 100 day. This is why you trade the charts, okay? So, I had to I was trading the short PSLS. Okay? Soon as I got down to this 100 day, I cut that loose and I scalped it long and I still got the long trade going here on Tesla and I got a 320 stop uh going. It got as low as 312 uh 36. I didn't get the bottom. I got I'm in 314. Got in a little bit late. No big deal. And I got a uh a stop there at 320 flat. And we'll see how that shakes out. Okay. So, what we're looking for here on the downside is this key level right here. Okay. So, you have this uh uh uh 311 uh can get them in here. Come on. Okay. 31153. That's going to be key. Now, that's loss here. We have 30489, your 200 day. Then we have 292 on your uh uh uh nine on your 50 estimate and then retest down here at 271. Now, on the upside here, what we're watching today's high we had so far is 32455 and we look at the bottom of there at 327. So there's your gap and then there's your fill. Look that 3 I mean 32733 and then we'll be looking for that 21day at 334 and then we can look at the 8 day at 345 level. Now you can see here how we had this negative divergence. See how we have this high. Okay, we had a high, we had this higher high and then we had this lower high. See this negative divergence. Okay, that's like a first tell and then she's selling right on off. Okay, now your green crossed over your red. That shows momentum to the downside which is obviously pretty obvious. Okay. So, right now it is watch this key 100 day. That's going to be very very crucial. If not, we'll tag that 200 day, 50-day, and maybe even a retest. Now, when you look on a weekly chart here, uh let me just see. Let's up here a little bit for you. Okay, there you go. There you're talking. Okay, came right on down here so far and we're holding that 312 uh 93 level, which lines up pretty nice here with the old 100 day. Okay, now again, we have this 8day sitting right at 30862 and then we have your 295. So when you're trading this and you're looking at downside, always put the weekly and your daily side by side here. It gives you a lot bigger uh picture of what exactly is what's going on then. Okay. So these are like your big targets. So we cruise if we lose this 21day that's going to be very very strong. Then we're going to go right to that 8 to that 50day and then come all the way down here to this 252 level. Okay. So this has a lot way a lot way to fall. Okay. If it keeps right on selling off here. Now again uh Tesla to me is a is a meme. It's a trading stock. Okay. there's uh you know as far as their their sales on their on their cars it's just declining okay that they're declining the revenue is declining now we got to see here I believe it's on the 17th or the 12th is going to be the um self-driving car that you're going to do in Texas so we got to see how that all paid paid uh uh takes off but if it's a flop okay this is going to come down really really hard okay so just remember that now if it can you know say hey wow this is a big success well then we have our upside targets here that we're looking for it's going to that 21 day, that 8 day, and then we have a big retest going on up there. Okay? So, always look at the chart here, especially this RSI. We see this negative divergence, but don't be afraid to trade this both directions. TSLs is an easy way to do the shorts. Okay, let's take a look at one of my favorites is race Ferrari. Okay, here we have race, your daily and your weekly chart. This is one of my favorite trades. Uh uh I like the the race. uh you know uh people with money uh it doesn't really make any difference if you're going to spend a half a million or a million dollars on a car. It doesn't really matter. Okay. Uh so what we got here is on the downside we're watching this is is 47954. Okay. Now you can see how that 8 day now is starting to c curl up and providing very very nice support. Now if that's loss we're going to come right to the bottom of this candle here looking at 47387. But look how nice here we had that consolidation of support level. Then we can go down here to this uh uh 369 level, which is basically just the bottom of that candle. And then what we can do is we can work the candles down, but you're going to be targeting that 50-day at that 458. And then we have your 100 day and your 200 day right about that 456 level. Okay, so everything really gets support here. Now, we did have this gap down. Okay, so what we're watching is when we watching this 21 day, that's going to be key. 486. Now, if we can get above that, then this right here, this is 484. It's a little bit below, but that's your gap. And then right to the bottom of this candle is your fill at 490. So if we can get to do this uh 21 day and we get above it, then you're going to be ready in that gap and you're going to be tagging that uh that uh 49061 level. Okay. Then we look to the upside 49407. Okay. Then we'll look to the bottom of that candle at that 495. So we have another gap and another fill and then we have your retest up there at 503. Now you can see here, see how we had this double top situation. Let me just take that down a little bit there. So, okay, see where how we had this double top situation and then she came right on down. But right now, we're doing a nice good consolidation. But you want to watch the top of this candle right here. This is going to be very key at 484. That's your gap. And then we have your 21day. Okay. If we get above that, then we can go into that fill and go higher. Okay. So, now on the downside, just watch this level right here. But besides that 8 day, if we lose that 8 day, then just watch this level right here. This is going to be very very key uh uh support level because how many times has been holding and then we go down to that 469 level which is be right there. Then we come down here to that 50 100 day and 200 day. Now you can see here how it got to an overbought condition. See that overbought condition. Okay, double top double top and then then she's selling right on off here. But now we're doing a little consolidation. The green is below your red here. Um this here looks really good. I would be back in this thing if once it closes above that 21day because then I know we have the gap to fill the gap to fill and then we have that nice big retest. Now when we look at here on the weekly chart look how nice this just uh 8 days is holding here. Okay so look at this chart. Look at bottom left upper right very very nice uh uh uh uh trading chart here. Okay so here was that double top uh situation going on here. But you notice here, look at how that 8 day crossed over that 21 day and now we're holding it here on a weekly basis. And that's what we're looking for is on a weekly basis. Okay? Now, obviously, if that's lost, you got targets down here at the 21day. And we have the 50-day all the way down here at the 52 level, which would be right around this kind of a area right here. Okay? Uh but right now here, we don't really worry about that. We're worried about is just this 8 day at that 473 level. That's what we are targeting here on the downside. If you can re on up here, we have that 509 uh uh target that's right up here, but you're going to hit that 503 first. But just watch the gap in that fill. That's going to be very very uh uh uh crucial, I said, on the trading for the upside. Okay, take a look here now at Goldman Sachs. Okay, here we have Goldman Sachs. Now, this is one of my favorite uh bank stops. Goldman Sachs and JT Morgan. I think that's the best of the breed right there. Yeah, you can Yeah, you can go Bank of America, you can go Wells Fargo, get all that. I like Bowman and I like JP Morgan. I think those are the best. This is what I like to trade. Okay. So, you can see here how we had that uh you know high lower high lower high. We had this same as the regular uh uh uh Dow, NASDAQ and you know S&P here. Then we rallied right up here and now we're consolidating here. Okay. So, now look at this 21day. See, look how nice this is. Okay. Did it go through there? Yes. But right now we're back above it and that's going to be the key is going to be that holding that 5 98 level. Okay. We also have this 604 level which we're bas we're above right now. Now if we lose this 8 day and that 21 day, then we have this uh uh uh 100 day sitting right here. But you always have to watch the bottom of this candle here. This is 58250. There's your gap. And then we want to look to the top of this candle right here at 572. There's your fill. But that's only if you lose this 21 day to 100 day. Then we can come down to this fill level before we hit the 20 200 day and the 50-day. Okay. Now upside we really want to hold this key level this 60466 on a closing basis. If we do we can rally right back up and retest that 62079 level. Okay. So now again if we get above that then all we got to do is bring this price channel right across and we're going to be looking right top of that candle at that 62878. Then we just follow the candles all the way up here. You got 637. We got 647 and then we have a big retest up here at 672. Okay. So I have a long position in this I've had for a long time. Okay. So, what I'm watching is this 62079. Okay, we close above this. Okay, we had this double top right here. So, I just got to be a little bit careful. But if we close above that, then I will get back in and and add to that position. And then I think we're going to be hitting all the rest of the targets here. Okay. Uh until it does that, for me, it's just a trading kind of a stock. Okay. But you can go balls out once it gets above and close above that 620 because then she will go higher. Okay. Now, we got to an overbought condition situation here. Now we're just kind consolidating. Your green is below your red, but that's still looking very very nice here. As long as we hold this 21day. Now here we look on the uh uh uh weekly chart here. We do have that there's that gap situation that kind of at 48250 and then we look to the top of that candle at 472. Okay, just same thing as we had here and here. Okay, so but what we're watching as long as we hold this 21 day, see how nice that uh 583 is. And look at your 8 day. Now it crossed below that 50-day, but now it's railing right on up here once it crossed. Okay, so just watch that 8 day if that 21day is lost at 576. But right now, this is looking, you know, actually really really good kind of a situation. Long as we consolidate here and we hold that 21day, this can rip up to that that 620 and we crack a crack above that, then we can just start hitting all these level and maybe even retest that 5 or uh 672 level. Okay, let's take a look here now at Amazon. Okay, here we have Amazon. Another one of my other favorite trades. Just a matter of fact, I I love the company. You just make a call and then wait for the doorbell to ring. Well, actually, they don't even ring the doorbell anymore, but they they'll send you an email that your package is at the door. So, that works worked out really good. Another thing I like about what Amazon is doing is where I live, they just put an Amazon distribution center in there, which is nice. Okay. When they used to deal with the UPS, Yeah. you'd get it, you know, anywhere from 3:00 in the afternoon till 8:00 at night package. This by 1:00 we got the package. They they take a picture right off your front door. They they sent you an email so you know exactly what you got right now. I mean, I just love the process and I think eventually they're going to do that to everything and just eliminate the the UPS and the FedEx and they just do it on their own. I think it's a really really good system. Okay, now here we're looking at we got the same consolidation kind of situation. Okay, so we're we're watching on the upside is that 21484. Okay, so that's going to be the retest and then we have to see what the reaction is once it gets there. Okay, if it breaks through, then what I do is I add to my position. And then what I'll do is we'll just take it up to the next level, which would be right here. Okay, all you got to do is bring that price channel across. You got 2197. And just follow the old candles up here. 22331 until you get all the way back up here to the top of this gap. See this 23481, there's your gap. Look to the bottom of that candle. 236 gap fill. And then your big retest up there at 242. But the beauty of the price channels is all you got to do is just bring them right across. And that's all going to be your your upside targets and your resistance levels. Very easy. But we have to get and close above this key 21484. So for me, this is just a trade until we can get above that level. Okay, 21484. So if it closes, say above that, close at 216. Just because it's a little higher doesn't mean you can't buy on strength. Okay, that's also a key is when you buy on strength when it's rolling up here, then you know when if it closes above that, then we can hit the next levels. Okay. Now, here on the downside, we're watching this key level right here. This is going to be that 8day, 20658. We have Oho over here, uh, sitting at 205. And then we have your 21day at 20395. And then we have your 200 day, uh, sitting right there at 202. So, you got a lot of good support right underneath. But look at this how it's holding this 21day. See how it's held here? Held, held, held. See, this is very, very nice here. And that 8 days curling up. 21 days curling up. This looks like it just wants to go higher. Now, your RSI here, we never got to an overbought uh uh uh situation. And now we're trying to rip right back up here. Very, very nice. And we got a really good green. We got a sideways action. So, let's just see where target would be. If we can get above that 21484, then we can either add to position or take a new position and then we can start hitting all these candles. All right. Uh weekly chart here. Very, very nice here. There's that big gap. Okay. So, you always want to watch that gap. 197.85 and then we have 19469 gap and fill. if we lose that 21day 50-day on a closing basis and this 8 day. Okay, but you got a lot of good strength here. We just had a little sideways consolidation. Now you can see here we got to an oversold condition. Now she's trying to rip right back up here. The green cross your red. So this weekly chart looks very very nice here to do a nice good retest. The key is is closing above right here above that 21484. Okay. So if it gets in that area, we got to see we don't want no pop and drop situation. We want to make sure that firmly closes above, then we can go higher. If it closes above, okay, that's what we're looking for. All right, that's what I got for you. Uh I'll be back here after you'll pick close. We'll take a look here at uh uh Bitcoin, at gold, silver, uh crude oil, natural gas, and uh then we'll take a look at the indexes, the Dow, the S&P, and the NASDAQ. Now, remember, we're doing a meltup here, but again, I just want to repeat myself here. And when you have these meltups here that are going up, okay, so what it is is is uh for retail traders, it's FOMO. Oh, I'm fear of missing out. I gotta get in. I gotta get in. But the big boys, you know, I'm saying the big boys, the hedge funds, those kind of guys are selling their positions out to those retail traders. Okay? So when this, you know, when you have a meltup like that, okay, it only melts up so far and then when it does, it turns and it sells off really, really hard and it leaves all these retailers, retail traders stuck. Okay? So don't be one of those guys that are or girls that are stuck there on the top. You want to make sure, you know what I'm saying, that you use a stop-loss that you know when to get in and you know when to get out of the situation. Okay? That's what you that's that's the key to trading. Okay? So if you miss a little bit, doesn't really matter. Okay, long as you get in the bulk of the situation. It's the same way like TQQ. That's one of my favorite trades. Now you're melting up here again. Okay, you're up another 2%. Okay, you show you're ringing up. I'm in from 6750. It's sitting right now at 75. But I I keep raising the stop up al as as it as the day progresses. Okay, so always always remember, take money, put it in your pocket. Okay, that's what I got for you. Trade what's in front of you, not what you want. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music]"
