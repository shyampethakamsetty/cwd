  "transcript": "Good afternoon everyone. This is Henry and in tonight's video I thought I'd bring you three different symbols, a little bit more ideas on the spiders which we'll get to in just a moment, but wanted to bring Door Dash to you. Now, this may have been covered a few times, but either way, it has so many favorable qualities that I just like you to see. First off, the weekly squeeze. So, as is the focus of most of these videos, the squeeze is the foundation for directional movement. But remember that not all squeezes are created equal because they will show up when the stock is exhibiting different patterns, right? You know, this squeeze was bullish, but the pattern of the chart was very different back in here. The thing I like about it at current prices is you see how from swing high to swing low, you're clearing the 786 retracement. Once you start getting above that, you know, bearish or retracement measure, it sets you up for four targets. The first of which is going to be the old swing high and then you see two, three, and four shown on the chart here. So, you know, I'm not going to tell you that this is at a huge discount as this weekly chart keeps pushing up, but if you get into the heart of June and we can find some weakness in the broad markets, I think that's one you set up in a bullish way more towards the uh latter half of the year. And I expect Door Dash to to do well. Now after that I wanted to bring you gold which we have looked at gold a few times but you know I continue to bring it to you in these video newsletters because the squeeze is still active. So again as this is the foundation of my directional trades you can see that when the squeeze makes its full directional move it helps the momentum start get to get going. Now, that's not to say it's going to be in a perfectly straight up line, but if you can give this week a little bit of leniency, you know, look at the move that that squeeze started. So, here we can see something similar where the squeeze has been in play for a while, currently in that low compression version. And I just, you know, I'm keeping it on my watch list every day because if you find it that day where it's down 50 or 60 points, something like that, I think that's where you have your discount and you really try to pick some up with an edge again for the second half of the year. And that'll give you a little bit of diversification, you know, and not just stocks. And then finally, the spiders, which the spiders we discussed in last Thursday's video newsletter, trying to see if we could get a gap up on Monday to open up the unbalanced fly. We were not able to get that, but I give it to you because I think it is worth looking at. Again, if we come in here and look at the ETF, the idea would be that if we get any strength to kick this off, and we'll look at it through the non-farm payroll data, but then you would come in and look at something like the $600 call option. So, if we move up here and we think, all right, 600's going for a $130 now. If the market is strong tomorrow, look to see if you can do this unbalanced butterfly for a better credit. You know, if you can put the body at 600 and say you take that in for a 50 c credit, you now have a very high probability strategy on. If we are weak as we get into the start of the week on Monday and Tuesday, this will be very easy to manage. If the markets happen to be up, can they still hold resistance at 600? That's been a very important theme of this market and I think it'll be good for another week. So, I hope that gives you something to think about as you start to set up your spreads for tomorrow. You guys have a great Friday, and I hope to see you in the room for the close. Hey traders, this is Henry with simplertrading.com. I wanted to thank you for watching today's video.
