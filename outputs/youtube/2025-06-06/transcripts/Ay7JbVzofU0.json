  "transcript": "sound check. Good stuff, TG. And um just taking a look here. No, I don't I don't have any CRWV. I've been out of that for a little bit. And uh yeah, what a you know, what goes up, you know, must come down kind of a situation there. And you know, not really not a lot of momentum happening today in the indexes. Very quiet. We'll look at a we'll take a couple different looks here. But if we go back here and this is, you know, we look at the S&Ps here, you know, from this morning, we did have that nice move this morning and, you know, there was some momentum there. I shared that chart earlier. Did the put credit spread and then I was kind of working out. I missed this down move. Uh, we got the retest and did a call credit spread. We flushed. I thought we were going to get a slower move, you know, possibly down to 59.40 on the S&Ps and instead we just got this big bounce. So now we're just kind of looking to see like all right from here are we going to kind of work our way down or work our way up? The jury is still a little bit out. Uh you can see that since we fell this kind of falling 8 EMA on the 15minute has been resistance and you know just kind of kind of hanging out there. If we look at let me get rid of the the fibs here. you know, it's generally on the 30-inut chart. You can see we've got the squeeze setting up to the downside. We've got I'll clear this. Let me clear off the drawings. Hello. Hello. Come on, Thinger Swim. You can do it. Wow. I I do have a lot of charts open right now as I've been playing around with different settings and things like that. So, I'll get that cleaned up. This will be a little bit faster. So, if we step back here and just kind of look at the 30-inut chart, you know, kind of with the Momo stuff, it's been a little quiet. And the 30-minut chart I look at more for kind of bigger moves and things like that. And if we look at this, you know, some of the things that I like about this, you know, here we had a 30-minut squeeze. You can see you get momentum right up to the fire line and then when you get that reversal signal, it's kind of out. But then what I also like is there's a lot of comfort in gray. And what gray means is there's no no action. And that means you're typically not going to get some puke. Like if you're going to get a puke, you need to see the yellow momentum to the downside. So you drift down, drift down, drift down, you get the reversal, and then you know another squeeze and bada boom, bada bing. So on the 30 minute and that, you know, those are trades that could happen overnight and stuff like that. And then right now as we're kind of, you know, we had some action this morning, but we've had a lot of pressure. And when I see, you know, yellow like this that's indicating downside momentum. I'm kind of like, all right, well, you know, when you have momentum, that's when it can push through a voodoo line. And we do have a squeeze setting up. So, I've got a call credit spread on. I'm a little underwater on it. I got in, you know, frankly, a little a little late, uh, or a little early, I guess you would say. Um, but but everything's still teed up here that we could kind of roll over into the close a little bit. We'll see. I like Microsoft. I like Meta. I'm not in Tesla, but I'm watching it as kind of an indicator here because if that starts to if that starts to bounce, I think the S&Ps will bounce. And if you look at the Tesla momentum, again, not something I traded today, it's uh you know, you kind of pick your battles, but pretty astounding. And then if we look at the S&PS on this right now as it sets up here and um and I was talking about this earlier. So on this I've kind of looked at, you know, I've got the two-minut and the five minute and the 15-minute and and what I look for on this is that, you know, the two-minut is, you know, here we were kind of rallying, rallying, rallying. And then if you get a sell signal and like the yellow momentum, that's a good sign that it's ready to roll over. And then the other thing is that if you get a rally back to a fib level and it's gray, and I I'll talk about this tonight in the webinar, that's a good indication that you're not going to blow through it. So there's a couple So gray is actually good, too. gray can be um kind of depending on what you're looking at there. It's like, okay, if I don't want it to blow through that, yeah, you want it to be gray. You don't want it to turn blue. And then right now, we're just kind of all over the place. And if we're looking at, you know, some of the kind of key stocks and things like that, you know, Meta's flat on the day. We've got uh, you know, possible pins setting up for tomorrow at 700. Probably do a little clean up there. Microsoft is just, you know, a champ. If Microsoft wasn't this wasn't this strong, the S&Ps would be a lot I think, you know, they'd be under a lot more pressure today. You can see the S&P on this 30-inut chart, we got that squeeze setting up right now to the downside. I think tomorrow we could easily rally with the NF, you know, non-farm payrolls, but certainly, you know, we are at o key overhead resistance levels, and I don't, you know, I don't necessarily think we're going to blow through them, but I I think that the idea we could push through 6,000 at least for a test makes sense. So, so that's what we got there. Um, let's look at a couple of our positions. In fact, why don't we just bring this up here? So, on a 30-minute chart, if we're looking at Microsoft, oh, and also too, as we as we the the two things I'm looking at as we get into the close, so ticks, obviously, you know, we had that big spike down, that was a big tick reading, and then we immediately kind of ramped back up. Now, we're just kind of hanging out here. And then just keep an eye on the VIX. Keeping an eye on the VIX here. So, the VIX, it's been a little all over the place today. It's traded as high as a little a little over 18, as low as 17. You know, we've been used to these five and six point ranges. This is kind of quiet, but we're, you know, we're kind of, you know, keeping an eye out here. If the VIX starts popping here into the close, we're going to flush. And again, today's close is today's close is today's close. I think tomorrow will be a much different day. Microsoft at all-time highs right now. And then so let's look at our Microsoft trade because we do have some of the stuff that's expiring tomorrow. So for our longer term call debit spread 15 days out that's looking pretty solid. I like the idea of holding this into tomorrow. We're at new all-time highs. You know, we're in what's called blue sky territory. We also have this butterfly and man, I forgot how much I hate five point wide butterflies. We've, you know, the stocks moved pretty good and the butterflies up, you know, 50 cents. And I'm kind of half joking, but it makes me really appreciate 10, 15, and and, you know, 25 point wide butterflies. So, basically, we want to hold on to this tomorrow because tomorrow's kind of if this thing is going to pay off, it's going to be tomorrow. And then Meta Um, so Meta, we've structured this a little bit differently. So Meta, if you recall, you know, we sold this put credit spread, you know, at two bucks to kind of help finance our $10 wide butterfly. And so the $10 wide butterfly at least a little bit more traction here. So what I'm going to do at this point is that um even though we have some cushion here um risking, you know, I we got to acknowledge that Meta could gap down 10 points tomorrow, right? Um, and I would be fine. You know, it's like going, okay, well, if this is $2 and we gap down 10 points, I can I can manage that. But, you know, if we've got a point of profit here and we gap down 10 points and suddenly, you know, that's now we got now we're, you know, that could go sideways pretty quickly. So, I'm going to go ahead and close this out. And I got a little slow action happening here. And I I'm not going to be a, you know, a dick for a tick here. Let me just get out. Get out. Do not be dick for tick. E. Goal is accomplished. Oh, it just it just popped there for a second. Now, you know, Jonathan, I almost want to put on an iron fly on the S&P for tomorrow for the I think it's, you know, I think the market is kind of absorbed a lot at this point. So, we'll look at AV Joe and SPX for tomorrow. All right. Um, for Meta, I'm going to hold my call debit spread and butterfly for to for tomorrow. But I'm going to go ahead and book the put credit spread here at current levels. Yeah. So we'll just kind of look at that. I mean, I think um you know, this market is the market this market has had a lot thrown at it and so I think the idea that it can it can handle anything at this point, you know, makes a lot of sense. All right, so that so we looked at Meta and Microsoft. Um the other one we want to look at here is I did pick up some Fatu Foodoo yesterday. Somebody asked me about C uh weed stocks. I I just am not interested in that. It doesn't mean that there's not a trade there. It's just, you know, I just think there's other there's other things to do. It's like, you know, when you go to Disneyland, you don't have to ride every ride. You know, it's like, hey, I want to do Space Mountain and I'm good. Okay, that's a weekly chart, daily chart. Coming down to the 21. Um, I would be totally fine adding to this trade. So, let's look at where it is now. Futu. So, I do like when it's a little stretched like that, I typically will scale in to give me room to add to it. And I don't mind picking up some here at current levels. And then, uh, also even doing, you know, possibly one more I'm a huge fan of, you know, especially if it's bounced because it's like, all right, well, it may it may rip here, but it may come back. And when it comes back, you should be like, you shouldn't be like, oh, damn, you know, it's not working. It's like, oh, great. I can I can I can add to this position. But you don't want to martinale it. Like, you don't want to average your way out of it. you just want to plan and say like, okay, I'm not gonna, you know, I just want to I want to be able to kind of standard operating procedure there, you know. So, if I want to build up a 60 contract position, then I can, you know, I got one more bullet there in the gun for Futu. Uh, I'm going to add to it as it comes back to visit its 21 EMA. Yeah, let's look at those two. Um, yeah, let me, you know, let me show you the when I talk about uh I can talk. So if you look at this, this is what made me kind of when I got the call credit spread earlier. I started looking at the buildup here. And when I say like a charm pocket, I'll say like right here, it's kind of see where the that negative the red and the purple meet. That's kind of that can be kind of a place where we end up. Doesn't mean that we will, but that kind of becomes a magnet. And so that's 5950. And then if it got really ugly, we could end up down at 5860. I absolutely do not expect that to happen. But, you know, this is a weird market right here. And then there's also this here at 5920. So, what I kind of like today is the idea that, you know, we we may flush and just buying some cheap out of the money puts and letting them cash settle just in case we absolutely puke. I don't I'm not saying that we will. I think 5950 here looks pretty good at least, you know, for that call credit spread that we did and taking a little bit of heat on except for uh uh you you got whoever got it at 11 bucks. You know, you you crushed that one. So, yeah. So, that's looking good there. So, but this this has me a little scared now. There's not anything here, but that's just I and I'm being facitious, right? Not like, oh my god. But it it looks it makes me think this close is a little a little effed up. You know, this is going to be a different close than what we've seen. There's some interesting there's some possibilities for Snafu. Um, all right. So, somebody said DOG. Let's look at that one. Yeah. You know what? Similar to um yeah, look, it looks great. This is the thing like with with Futu as well, your best entry is going to be closer to the 21 EMA. So, if you're buying here, you're just kind of like, all right, well, you know, I can add to it if it comes down, which which is fine. And then I think the other one was dual lingo if I'm spelling that right. They got a lot of backlash when they came out and just said, \"Yeah, we don't need we get we just, you know, we're using AI now.\" So, I like that, too. 21 EMA all day long. All right, let's come back here and look at the indexes. We are getting some weakness. Let's look at um So, same thing here. So, see when like we come up here. So, I got the momentum on this chart, right? This was uh the futures. We rallied up to that 4hour quant pivot H2 and then when we went gray, that's kind of a sign that that's all that's all you're going to get. And so, which is great. And then um and same thing here on this rally. See how it's gray? But when you get momentum and you come up to a level, you can blow right through it. And and all right, so S&P's here. So, let's see if we can actually break to new lows. I actually feel like I need to get some more downside action here. So, on our call credit spread, I'm going to So, I want to go ahead and exit. Uh, let's see if we break here. I'm going to go ahead and exit. Yes. Suck on this. All right. This may happen very quickly. So, I'm just going to get out. We got it. I got the shittiest entry at 690. I think some of you guys got it at 11. That's great. Let's go ahead and get out. And and a fair question might be like, well, if you think it's going to go lower, why don't you just hold on to it? Well, I yeah, I like it lower and it's still going lower, but if it reverses very quickly, it's hard to get out of a spread. So, I actually, you know, I'd rather buy a cheap put here and risk the debit than, you know, risk this thing just because it it's hard to get out of it. Spreads are a pain in the ass if the market is moving against you. But we should be able to get out of this. Yeah. Come on. There we go. Bam. Nice. Nice. Nice. Nice. Puke, puke, puke, pukey, pukey. Um, who got it at 11? Please tell me you held on to it. Oh, out at 8. Oh, that's okay. No. Where is he? But where's the guy that got it at 11? Frederrico, do you still have it? Did you get out? Tell me what your exit was. I'm waiting with baited breath here. Not in a 10 out at 2.5. Yeah. Okay. No, that that's not bad. You you crushed it, Fred Rico. Nice work. Okay. Yeah, I love it because I got in and you guys got like better entries than me and then um so, you know, I I love it. All right. So, legit selloff, right? This is this is um this is what I was looking for. And I'm a little I'm a little uh miffed that I did not aggressively get puts because now it's going to be now it's kind of too late. Let's see what we look we're looking at on the Momo here. Again, I'm watching six different screens. So if we look at um so again just as kind of a reminder here you can kind of see this is the you know 1 hour 30 minute 20 minute 10 minute you know 4 minute so you can see the momo when you see that it gives you comfort to kind of hang on for a little bit more again spreads that you know for directional and then if we if we look at the labels here then we can the I mean I God I haven't seen this in a while. Hold on, let me get a screenshot. This is a good example for tonight. Oh my god, Tesla. We got to buy calls at the close tonight on Tesla because, you know, this is overdone. $57. I'm sure his mom is tweeting him right now like, \"Boy, you need to keep your mouth shut.\" Look at the So, so now on the two-minute Look at this. Geez. Okay. I'm a little I'm a little frankly I mean I'm being facitious when I was talking about let's get some puts because this thing may collapse into the close that I didn't just grab the puts but that's okay I some yeah Tesla's going down with every Elon so I will buy calls on Tesla on the close because this is so overdone okay so So now, so now, man, so much for a choppy close. All right, let's come back here and look at trace. I mean, I'm not I'm not complaining. It's so funny doing this when you're it's like your your platform is slow answering questions. And look at this. Okay, so look at this. So we've come right down to this charm pocket, right? Doesn't mean we're going to end up there, but we've tested it. But this is in play now. Now, if I come over here at 5860, there's no there's nothing here. So, may you know, maybe that's not going to happen. But that that's a that's in play. So, just, you know, that's that's a little hairy if we were going to puke that far into the close. So, I kind of want to get something just in case that actually happens. So now now look here's here's the secret to this because you can't you can't so if you made money today you cannot do a trade that would risk you that going to the negative. Okay. So, if I was going to do 100 contracts, you know, I'm not going to buy 100 contracts of the 5950 in the money puts at 25 because if that reverses on my ass so fast that I struggle to get out of it like and I lose eight points on it, then I go negative on the day. Okay, that's that's just called irresponsible trading. However, if there's the potential of this thing just absolutely crushes to the downside, these 5900 puts are interesting. But I want to see if first we can get a little you again look at this. This I mean look likely this is going to hold. But this is in play. That's kind of a scary close if that actually happens. So, so when I'm looking at this, I just have to realize that this this these will probably go to zero. And keep in mind that I'm was doing 100 lots. I'm just going to do 10 on this with the idea that it could go to zero. So, if you were doing 10 lots, I would do one contract. If you were doing one contract, I would pass on this trade because the odds of this going to zero are pretty high. Okay? So, I'm not I'm not even going to post it because if someone's like just getting the alert and they're like, \"Oh my god, I got to make a big bet on this.\" This is not what this trade. This is just a Okay, there there's some weird pockets down there. This is probably going to go to zero, but it might it might it might go to 20. So, hopefully that all made sense. There's a different, you know, there's a difference between what I would call pure speculation and a planned out trade. Yes, XSP. Absolutely. Yeah. Now, so I just kind of wanted to grab it and then and then now let's come back here and we'll give it a minute because because look again, this is a long shot. This is a long shot, but it's a shot and it, you know, the way the market's acting here is kind of crazy. We could also come, you know, easily come back up to 5950, which frankly is more likely. All right, so hopefully that all makes sense. We're not yellowing our life here. um this big negative at 5955 that's kind of a magnet as is 5945. Okay, but so that's pro that's that's more likely. Okay, so again hopefully that'll make sense. All right, so the other trade then what we can do on this again I fully expect this to go to zero, right? If it doesn't, I'm I'm I'll be fine. But we're just, you know, again, I'm just talking just telling you out loud what I'm doing. Speculative trade, smaller size. So So then, you know, 5950 is kind of in play. So So what does that look like? What time is it? 2:23. Okay, I'm I'm It's too early for this. Let's give it a minute here. Oh no, Frederrico, you killed it, man. You sold it at 11 and bought it back at like five. That's You can make a living doing that. So that's when when you're out of the trade. No, you know, you don't want to start like fantasizing about having held it to the perfect. I mean, you know, we all do it, right? But it's you just capture a decent chunk of the move. That's all that's that's the name of the game. Yeah, Tyler, I'm looking at that, too. So, um I almost I almost like the idea of buying the 5950 calls here as well, but let's We're a little early. I'm watching. Um, let's just give it a minute. Catch our breath. Holy crap. Elon is in the Epstein Falls. Is he just declaring war? I'm not. Okay. I mean, that's that's pretty awesome. I mean, you know, you go I mean, you know, Elon don't care. I don't know if that cl that counts as balls of steel or, you know, brain cells of an amoeba. Um, yeah, we're So, yeah, we'll look at some potent. So, I do want to look at Tesla here because I think this is a ridiculous move to the downside over tweets and Friday tends to be an update, right? So, this would be the same thing, just kind of like a scorched earth policy. Um, if we come over here and we look at the 280 calls, they're eight bucks, right? That's insane. Um, the $300 calls, you know, a butterfly I think is a butterfly, frankly, is tricky just because, you know, the pricing mitch m the mismatch there. I think the $300 calls though overnight in case it just gaps and rips is interesting risk-to-reward. He, you know, Elon may be on a full-on um ketamine trip right now and he just absolutely doesn't care and his mom's like, \"Bro.\" Okay. So, again, I'm gonna So, I'm going to buy some $300 calls here for tomorrow. Again, I'm just risking the debit here. And I'm not I want to point out here, this is an account where I'm fine doing 100 lots. I am not doing 100 lot. I'm doing a 10 lot. Okay? This is position size. If you're doing a bigger concentrated trade, you don't want it to be, you know, you don't want it to be a um what's the word I'm trying to say? You don't want it to be this isn't something that you should lose sleep over. This is just wow. This is this is kind of pa a pathetic overreaction. Now, if you want to do a bigger trade on something like this, you go out to next week and and likely do like a debit spread. So, you know, the 300, you know, the 300, 320, something like that, which I actually kind of like that. So, that one I wouldn't mind doing a little bit bigger size because we have time on our side. So the 300 325, you know, $5. Okay. You know, what are we willing to risk on that? A little bit more. This is one I'll post. So I'm going to do 25. Again, I'm not, you know, this is not um since this is more speculative. If it's not like a, oh, this is a setup that I can manage. This is just like a, okay, this thing is overdone and I'm willing to take that bet. Let's see. All right. So, let me post. That's when I'll post. Uh, it' be nice. Okay. So, I'm gonna hold this overnight. I don't I'm not planning, you know, I I think the overnight move is the interesting move here. Okay. So, things, you know, and again, you can see kind of the big So, 59. Oh, this is rolled down. Okay. This is rolled down. This was like two minutes ago. This was up at 59.50. So the fact that that's rolled down, you know, this this door opens, this is going to be a really super interesting close. Meta is holding up. It's only down, you know, three points. Microsoft still up three and a half points. El Elon is like the um you know what's funny is like you know so my kids I've watched them you know grow up on Roblox and 14-year-olds roasting each other to death on Roblox and they actually have zero emotional reaction to it like it's just normal is hilarious because that's on online like I think of answers like I go oh well you know I should have a thoughtful response here and kids don't think like that. Elon is like a 14-year-old boy texting on Roblox. Yeah, I saw a PLTR crushed as well. That was weird. Yeah, I I read an article. I think it was Tim Ferrris and um he had said something that long term like ketamine for therapy, you know, if you do it, you know, doing it like 15 20 times and that it's does more long-term damage. You know, I'll try anything once, stuff like that. But it's like the idea like anything like that that you build into a habit, right? It just it's see gota be a little careful. I mean it is for horses, right? All right. Getting a little bit of a bouncy bounce here. Guess we should get some more Tesla. That thing's bouncing down 17% at its max today. Um, a couple years ago for our horses, we gave them I don't know if it was fentanyl. I don't know what it was. The vet gave us these drugs. They're like, \"Do not take these, but you need to give them to your horses before the fireworks go off.\" I'm like, \"All right.\" So I gave it to him and they all just they all stood there watching the fireworks like totally chill. It was hilarious. And then the next day I was out hiking and like the these are these were big horses and four of them they were up in my grill like nuzzling me like give me got got any more of that whatever you gave us yesterday. You got any more of that? Come on man give us some more of it. 1500 lb animals trying to corner me and and shake me down. It might have been C. Yeah, I'm not sure what it was. The doc, the the the vet was very much like, I'm not supposed to give this to you. Don't take it. I'm like, all right. You know, small town vets, right? It's like, eh. All right, let's see what else here looks interesting. So, not not an impressive bounce in the indexes. Um, I I would like to do kind of another S&P NDX trade here into the close. Uh yes. Yeah, that was a filled that was a filled trade. It's a little higher now, but it's fine. Like the premise here is not we're not trying to like make 50 or 60 cents on this. I want to hold it overnight. I want to see, you know, what tweets come out tomorrow. Bitcoin is getting crushed. I haven't Gosh, I mean, it's so much going on today. Let's take a look at BTC. Now, look, when I talked about, remember that cycle high I was telling you about? That was on May 26th. That's a weekly chart. And since then, we've just been dropping. So, that's what I mean. Like, the psych the cycle highs when they come in, like they don't work all the time, but they work a lot of the time. Like, stocks kind of shook it off. But you know when it's kind of like oh god why is this coming down? It's just because these things do move in these kind of symmetrical cycles dissociative anesthetic. Yeah. Okay. No that makes sense. All right, I'm just giving this a minute, guys. I just kind of I just want to see how these markets are kind of shaping up here. Um, okay, I got that. Okay. Um, let's look at a So, Spotify. Yeah, let's look at some of the Bitcoin stuff. Spotify. Oh, before I forget, I have a friend of mine that works at this company. Again, just take this for what it is. Um, insiders are buying the crap out of the stock. Some uh they're they're into crypto and doing some stuff like that, too. Now, it is kind of looks like it's down a little bit today with Bitcoin. Uh, I just I just thought it was interesting and I'm just passing that along as an FYI, but the idea that, you know, whatever they're doing business-wise or they might get acquired. I don't have a position on it at the moment. I just wanted to share it before I forgot doesn't mean all that means is that somebody said something to me with some knowledge, but it doesn't mean that anything's going to happen, but it was from somebody that I would consider like, okay, that's something I want to pay attention to. So, I've just got that on my watch list now, and um, I'll keep an eye on it. Oh, is it top 100? Nice. Okay. Yeah. No, hh I did. Uh I'll show it again. And I'll talk about it tonight, too. So, the night So, so the nice thing about Momo, so like on the S&Ps, so a couple things. I don't know if you guys can see my mouse, but so here was um so this is a great example of where I'm really finding it useful because you want to know when there's momentum, but it's also just important to know when there's not momentum. So look at this swing high, swing low. We get a rally into um I think Treny John calls this the golden pocket, but this is always my favorite. You know that between that 50 and 618 and there's no momentum. So if it's just kind of gray and it kind of lobs into the this zone here, that's a great level to kind of get back in. And so and so that's great. So that's on the S&Ps. And then if we look at Tesla, so so D here, as I understand it, um it's a biioarma company, but it was bought or taken over by a crypto firm. And now, you know, they're doing all this alt crypto stuff. and then they realize that the patent at the bio company is actually worth something. So, it's just weird. It's just weird setup. I'm not saying I fully understand what's happening there. But that was something that kind of stood out to me. So, um so what happened I don't know if it was a spa or something like that, but essentially they did this transaction, they set aside the biioarma stuff, started focusing on crypto, and then they figured out that the bioarma stuff had some value. Yeah. No, Bruce. Awesome. No, I love some of your comments. I really I really appreciated them. So, you may see me saying some reiterating some of that tonight. So, Tesla, nice bounce here. So, look at green arrow there. That when you see that um pretty solid area and I think that's that's really what I found is interesting in the stuff too is it just kind of gives you confirmation like you know, you're not catching a fallen piano or anything like that. All right. So, S&Ps here are are having a Okay, let's let's come back here. You know what? Let me I'm going to go ahead and just buy I want to buy some longer term alts just to I just want to keep an eye on it because when I mention it and then I I move on to the next thing, I could forget. So, I'm just going to go out to um August. What is it at $10? Is there no volume? Look at that spreadsheet. As my daughter would say, I'm just going to come over here and say um 10. I'm fine getting a little taken advantage of, but not completely taken advantage of. They're not going to give it to me. Okay. Oh, now I'm the bid. Yeah, screw you guys. Okay, I'm just let me buy some shares real quick and then I'll remember that I have it to talk about it. I'm just doing this just to remember that we talked about it. Okay, I'll post that and then um we'll just continue to watch it. Okay. Um, buying 100 shares of this stock as well as 10 longerterm calls as it is something I want to keep an eye on. Um, crypto plus bio things happening. And then I'm just going to make that order GTC on the options because I don't, you know, I don't think I'm gonna get filled today. The market makers Uh, working this GTC order thin and market [Music] makers scumbags. All right, let's come back. Um, all right. So, look at this. So, we just got another kind of a walk up rally back to the falling 8 EMA here. And now we're, you know, okay, 240. All right, that's what I was waiting for. So, here we are at dose 40. I I love markets like this. It doesn't they don't really make any rhyme or reason, which is great. Okay, so now what we want to do is kind of come back where, you know, there's a lot. Look, this is 5920. Okay, but it's starting to build back up here again. We got a pocket here at 5960 to the upside and then down here at 5860. Now, I would say that 5860 probably isn't going to happen. [Music] Um but you know up here and look and the thing about it is we don't have to do a trade. So we gota you know there's nothing but this this is scary. I mean frankly because I have seen markets do this and um so that's why you know we got that one kind of put that's sitting there. So this will be an interesting close. Yes. You know what? Gosh, I keep, you know, there's so there's so many interesting things happening right now. And I forgot I was going to buy some uh that platinum. Does anybody know the ETF? I know the futures. PPLT. Thank you. Yeah, look at this move in platinum. PPLT. Yeah, great move. Hard. This This is This is setting up to be one of the better moves of like this is going to rally into 2026. So, it's tricky on stuff like this because now it's extended, right? But, you know, remember when there's a market having a move, it doesn't really care about the lines. um from a trading perspective, not a great entry, right? But if it's, you know, one of those things where you're just looking to, you know, reallocate money, you know, you just buy this ETF and hold it for a year. Yeah, the white metals here are they're poised for a great rest of the year, even SLV. So, I'm going to be watching them for pullbacks. And then the other one here is Palladium. I don't if you guys remember when platium went insane. Uh it's not it's kind of the weakest of them right now, but anyway, the white metals here are in Fuego. Um CRWV. So again, good case study on gamma squeeze up and then once everybody's blown out, you know, coming back down to earth. Hard to trade this, but you know, could we go all the way back? Could we go all the way back to 100? You know, absolutely. Abs smurfly. Look. Abs smurfly. Um, again, hard to get excited about something overnight. So, let's say, you know, let's say you want to buy the at the money straddle. It's eight bucks. Well, we moved $30 today, so it's not out of the realm of possibility. And then if we look at something for next week and we think, oh, it might be maybe there's going to be some more downside. Let's buy some at the money puts. They're $12. So, it's it's just hard, you know, it's hard to get your it it's just there were some good moves there and then at some point some point it becomes dangerous. You know, there's there's easier ways to make a living so to speak. The fact though that we took this out um and look everything reverts back to the mean and the mean is a hundred is is is the is about $100. you know, could it do that tomorrow? So, you know, same thing. So, I mean, the $130 puts are three bucks, so it' be the same thing. You know, do you just risk do you risk the $3? Um, but here's the part I got to emphasize is that, you know, there's I talk about when when momentum's lining up and doing a bigger trade, there's a couple things that happen with that. One, I'm not going to do a big trade that expires tomorrow, right? It's like, okay, I'm I'm I'm making this big trade and the next morning to the downside if it gaps up, I'm dead, you know? It's like, good god, did I just lose 10% of my account on that? That's that's irresponsible. This account, I will normally trade 100 lots on something like this. I would do 10 contracts. So, I think that's important to emphasize. This is just not, you know, this is just a it's a moment. It's a uh, you know, if I was going to do a bigger trade. Okay. Yeah. If I think it's going to go to 100, great. I'm gonna come over here and, you know, look at the June monthlies and then just say like, okay, I'll get some slightly in the money puts. Oh my god, they're $20. So, you know, you have to do it probably like a debit spread like the 13. Anyway, there's easier ways. I think there's easier things happening out there right now is the main point. There is a lot of um consolidation happening in crypto right now. Uh Robin Hood has bought three crypto firms. Kraken Kraken. They just bought Ninja um Ninja Trader. Pretty fascinating. Yeah. Okay. So, AVGO, let's look at that for earnings. So, so for AVGO, I I would say that similar to Nvidia, I I think the earnings are priced in like they could be fantastic. And are we going to explode up from here? We might, right? But I I I look at this and say this looks priced in. So I think someone mentioned that the risk is to the downside. I would agree, but I think it also could be something like Nvidia where it just, you know, it just kind of stays within the expected move. Uh who about Ninja Trader? Uh Kraken. Am I saying that right? It's the that crypto firm. Yeah. John, do you trade? Is that Do you clear on Kraken or who do you use for Bitcoin? Oh, Kraken. Thank you. Kraken didn't sound right. Release the Kraken like the big squid. Okay, so for AVGO, I think there's two trades to do on here. Implied volatility 153% expected move $16. So the first trade is simply saying that okay, the market makers have priced this incorrectly. Not incorrectly, they've priced it in. They've priced the move in correctly. And so for that trade, what time is it? Oh, we got 10 minutes. Man, time flies when you are having fun. So I'm going to go let's do the 260 280 and then the 260. 260 240. So $20 wide. And it's just all about the riskreward, right? So in this case, you know, my max loss is 6,800 against a max gain of 13,000. And and really what you're looking for is, you know, can you can you buy it back at a 40 40% or 50% of the credit received? And um if it gaps up and you look for it to come back down and vice versa. So So I like that. And I like to make it a little bit wider than the expected move to give it a little bit of cushion. And then from here, um, I'm just going to kind of, again, position size. The key with this stuff because it's it's it's kind of a you want to position size is if it's going to go to max loss. That's the whole secret with a trade like this because it's a binary event. You know, you have less control over it. And I'm I'm kind of getting down here in the middle just so I can get filled. All right. And then, you know, the question is is what happens if it's larger than expected to the downside? I'm kind of intrigued by, you know, do I buy some cheap 235 puts? You know, that would be that wouldn't add a lot of risk to the trade. you know, just in case it absolutely pukes. And you could also do that to the upside if you want to. I'm not sure. Let's see if I wanted to do that again because it adds more, you know, complexity and cost to the trade, right? So then you'd go to like the 285 call. So if it blows through it, it gives you um a little bit of so you're kind of covered on both sides, but it also means that if it stays within the expected move, you need to, you know, you're going to have to get 11, buy it back at least at 11 just to break even. Not the end of the world. The 285s, it's definitely skewed to the upside here. Like they're they're um you know, the calls there are more expensive. Eh, so I'm going to go with the 295s because they're the same price. So, so kind of by doing it this way, you know, you're kind of covered for a big move and a quiet move. And then the worst thing would be, you know, we open up at say uh, you know, 285 and trade there all day and then, you know, so anyway, hopefully that all makes sense for AVGO earnings. I'm starting with an at the money iron fly which would benefit from an expected move. And then I'm also buying out of the money puts and calls in case there is a surprise one way or the other. All right. So, that's AVGO and we can watch it. Four billion to buy. Geez. Okay. Let's get back to the S&P. Yeah. And and by the way, AVGO, I mean, you bullish, you got to be bullish semis, right? They're I mean, it's the wave of the future on so many different levels. So, this is just more about the earnings reaction. Oh, nice. Yeah. And I'm going to hold Tesla overnight. So, I I think that that move is way way way way overdone. Um, let me check in our trades real quick. Um, okay. Oh, it's ABGO. We bought some Voodoo, Meta, Microsoft looking good. SPX, nice trades today. And we got Tesla, which is going up. Okay, cool. So, anything else to do here on S&P into the last few minutes? There's four billion to buy. I don't if that's a great fake out. 5937. Let's take a quick last look at spawn gamma again. Look at this right here. 5930. We're just kind of walking back down to it. But then you got this huge strike here at 5950 again. It's just one of those days. So we lost money on this. Okay. Uh, no. We'll look at PLTR2. Yeah, it's almost like the MOC sometimes is a fake out. All right, we got five minutes. I I feel like I'm just I'm playing with hand grenades here. Um I'm going to I'm going to get in and if we get back up to 5950 if I can get these at 50 cents. So slow or 40 cents. Let's see if I can get them. Okay, so I got the 59.45 calls at 40 cents again likely could go to zero. Um, but if we go to that 5950 level, then you know it's pretty sweet. I'm just going to let them both catch settle. Like this is not this isn't the trade of the day, right? It's just like, let's see if we can kind of capture some of this weird end of day movement and whole lot of schniz here happening at the moment. Yeah, TLT was showing some promise. Um, really a good day yesterday. Had it started off today strong. kind of, you know, still kind of get finding its uh groove there. What a weird It's It's funny like today's kind of a strange day, but I I like these kind of days because it's very, you know, it's very methodical. It's let's come down, let's drift back up. You know, you know, these days make they make sense. Yeah. Well, for TLT, I did want to give it through uh the first week in June. So, we're almost into, you know, that's almost done. So, I'll hold it in through tomorrow and then, you know, kind of give it a few day. I mean, it's kind of technically still poised to rally into the first week of July, but you know, at some point at some point it's kind of like, are there, you know, better things to do with our time? Yeah, let's give it I'm going to look at it till next weekly. I mean, the reason I'm giving it more time is because we we got July, so we can afford to give it a little bit more time. And TLT is not, you know, when it cycles, it has these nice steady trends, and it just, you know, it just hasn't it just hasn't caught yet. I mean, it certainly bottomed, but it just hasn't caught. All right, three minutes left. You can see this little again, these little charm. I just, for lack of a better term, I just call them charm pockets. They just kind of attract. So, 5930 or Yeah, nice. I mean, yeah, it was up nice this morning from our from all the stuff we lgged into it. I think that's fine. I think is Trump uh taking out his uh taco nickname on Elon. I wonder if behind the scenes they're texting each other like, \"Bro, let's act like we're in a fight.\" Or if they're like really, you know, if it's a real thing. Yes. So, there's a there's a couple of like tweaks setups uh on the momentum indicators because we've we've we've had some users uh some of our longer time members also kind of test them out and incorporating the feedback. You just wanted to make sure that, you know, the idea behind them was kind of like what they're seeing too. And so, I just, you know, we like to make sure we get all that in there. And then I'll be showing some more examples and stuff tonight. Yeah. think it's like I'm kind of finding now it's it's always nice when you when you do something like that and it's like oh a chart looks naked without it and that's kind of the feeling with it which is which is great. Yeah, DDay it's probably too I mean I think he's kind of like look man what look at the sales. He's like oh yeah oh god they're they're going at it. That's like That's like a uh bathroom brawl. Oh, hey Tim. We're gonna go to uh Pelican, Alaska. So, you go to Juno and then you take like a you know a 4-hour ferry or a 40-minute plane ride, you know, puddle jumper and it's it was it's great. I somebody posted that tweet. I was like, \"Oh my god, that that's that's some that's slinging some mud right there.\" Yeah. Pel Pelican's amazing. Yeah. Look at If you guys are ever fishing Alaska, it's uh High Liner Lodge. So, you know, this is where Oh gosh, where is it? I'm sure they got photos. So, um I think they got a shot here of the town, but this is saltwater. And then you got, you know, you can catch fish there, but then you go out in the ocean, which isn't that far away there. And there's a bar right here. 50 people live here. And uh it's great. I mean, it's just a very, you know, there's like eight boats that fish out of there. Yeah, it it was amazing. Like if you if you like, you know, it's I I just it was great. So, we're obviously going back. We like it. But anyway, it's great. And of course, when you're there, you know, the sun's up 24 hours. That's weird. Take a sleep mask. Yeah, I think I've got I can show you guys. Um, I'm I'm trying to make sure my oldest goes as well. He didn't go with us last [Music] time. Get some time off of tech and all that fun stuff. Oh my god, I gotta use my authentication app. That's probably a good thing. And then we'll see what AVGO does. Instagram. Okay. 97 264. Trust this device. Yes. Again. Um, so I'm just trying to find um uh so if you So this is this is Bambi when I'm trading in Wimberly. I'm in Austin today. If we leave the door open, she'll just kind of come in and and check things out, which is always hilarious. And where is this? My daughter and I went to Babson for a week. It was entrepreneurial week. Speaking of fentanyl. So this guy's on fentanyl right now at this and he was a male kudu that we needed to transfer. So you dart him with a gun, right? Dart him with fentanyl and they just kind of you can see he's just kind of like peace out man. And then you got to load him up onto the trailer and then you shoot him with naron or whatever that is. And then that you know he snaps out of it. But you got about a 20 minute window because it'll kill him. But that's the only way you're going to get him loaded. And uh so he's he's just kind of hanging out there. And then we did this too. This guy is a bongo. And so you know we darted him. He's heavy. So it took one, two, six of us to move him. And uh that's you know it's crazy. So these are these people all know what they're doing. I'm just helping out and so that's what coralnake and then I'm trying oh so here's the um so this is us and pelican last year. So you know king salmon these are like rockfish. They're really good. Halibet my daughter caught this halibet that was 105 pounds. King salmon. Pretty amazing. Uh that was another 100 pound halibet. Anyway, it's great. I mean, great great great family trip. Uh, those are these are the kangaroos that we sent to Negger Island. That's Richard's assistant, Helen. She's like, Anyway, fun stuff. Just trying to see if there's anything else. Is that it? That was all the [Music] things. Oh, yeah. Yeah, this is when we were first got our animals and this is an orx. It was on the wrong so it was on the wrong side of the fence. So I'm trying to move it and um I totally Tony Robbins this. I visualized me being able to move the orcs and I put the the most muscle I could into moving it. It didn't budge one inch. So vis positive visualization visual the visualization did not work at the at all. Kind of like in trading you don't want to you don't want to visualize a trade working out. You want to visualize that you're following your rules. Yeah. And it was mad like when I was done I thought I was like I had a moment there was like going is this thing gonna kill me? Let's see. Anyway, that was so that was that. So let's see. Is AVGO out yet? Yeah, I'm about you know if you if you positive v visualization is great but in trading you got to be careful. You can visual visualize yourself as a good trader that follows your rules, but if you visualize that this trade is going to work out no matter what, you're dead. Um, yeah. And so, and then so the webinar, which is actually tonight, I think yesterday I was saying it was tonight. It's tonight. So, the webinar I'm doing tonight, it'll be about the Momo indicators. If you've already got it, great. Uh, you don't need to attend. If you want to, I'll be showing more examples. And then, of course, this Saturday, I'm going to be going over, you know, more examples, making sure you know how to use it. And then we're setting up for live trading. You know, I think I don't know if it's next week or the week after. It's it's been kind of a blur lately. There's a lot going on. Um, but of course, you know, we'll on the class we'll focus specifically on utilizing that tool. Uh well, yes. So, we'll be definitely be recording. We'll definitely be recording on Saturday. Oh, yeah. It's going to be a busy week. I need to make sure I'm doing my yoga. Keep my head clear. Lay off the ketamine. That was a joke. All right, let's just see. Does anybody know what time ABJ earnings are coming out? Like, I don't want to sit here for an hour, but if it's going to come out in the next 10 minutes or so, 4 p.m. There's a conference call. Stacy, semiconductor sector showing signs of a cyclical bottom. Yeah. Where were you like two months ago when it actually bottomed? Oh, are they okay? Let's take a look at those. Yeah, that makes sense. 315. Okay, Lulu. Yeah. Who wants to buy used yoga pants? You know, so this is actually something that's interesting to see because I think one of the questions right now is that there is uncertainty in the economy. So what are people cutting back on? You know, people are going to eat, right? But do they need another pair of yoga pants? So that's interesting. Doc sign sales guidance from okay might be an overreaction. Yeah, you don't need as many yoga pants, right? Interesting. Interesting. You know, it's funny now. I can't remember now the last time I've had to sign a document like physically. It's been a long time. Like everything's, you know, even even when I bought Simpler back, it was all DocYign or the equivalent, which is great because, you know, doing it and then like scanning it. It's such a pain. So much easier. Yeah. so much easier. Well, and yeah, Restoration Hardware got absolutely obliterated on earnings, too, right? I mean, this chart won't show it, but yeah, I think with real estate where you got to be careful is that that happens like with wires, you know, there, you know, there's smart program, you know, hackers out there that, you know, you wire something to the wrong institution and it's gone forever. So, you definitely want to, you know, call and all that fun stuff. Wow, Rick. I didn't know it's been around that long. Oh, let's go back to intraday. Ah, good point, Mitch. Oh, interesting, Chuck. Okay, that's a good that's a good quote. That new fert sofa is the first to go and last to come back when money is tight. Got the auto pen going. Oh yeah, let's look at PLTR. Yeah, so PLTR, you know, it came down pretty hard today. I mean, I I like the stock, you know, from a longer term perspective, but it's going to be, you know, you got the volatility there. So, let's look at PLTR just from a regular chart. PLTR. So, down 10 today. And again, structure- wise, not horrible. I mean, certainly and certainly we broke through support, right? And that's where you get kind of that liquidity rush. And then if we're looking at it from a day trading perspective in terms [Music] of that's the uh yeah, that was a 10point bounce in Tesla right there from when that set in. If we look at it from um just a day trade, it's like, okay, you know, how do you have confidence that the down, you know, the down move is going to keep going and um so a couple things here. So on these 15-minute charts, I'm really kind of looking at especially the reversals, those are those are pretty substantial. And then, you know, on the five and the two, you're just kind of looking like, oh, we're getting momentum. We're getting momentum. And then when it turns gray, it just kind of means that the momentum is kind of slowing. But if you don't see in this case that green reversal, you know, you're not really looking for much to the upside and then finally you got one kind of towards the end of the day. So I'll be talking the the gray the gray is actually helps a lot too. So it's, you know, looking at all the things there. Dear God, the spa. Uh, okay. I need to bring up Twitter. I mean, I'm missing all kinds of stuff. Elon must be locked in a room like somebody they're banging on the door like get him off the computer. Is it time to create a new political party in America that actually represents 80% of the middle? Trump should be impeached and JD Vance should replace him. Elon Musk, yes. Dear God, he's in the Epstein files. That's Have a nice day. Wow. The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's government subsidies and contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it. Man, that was a that was a probably the biggest breakdown of a bromance in the history of Earth. Um, Elon has never asked for a thing. I mean, I got rid of them. He's never asked me for a thing. I think it's an amazing attribute. Yeah, man. That's a grab the popcorn and watch. It's insanity. Yeah, that I mean it's like you can't make this up. Like you this is if this was on a Netflix series, you'd say this is an exaggeration. Nobody would they would nobody would speak to each other like that in public. All right, AVGO's out. Let's see. Initial flush down. Remember the expected move is 16 points. So if it moves up or down 16 points, that's expected. Yeah. Like House of Cards was tame compared to what compared to this. So move down 12 points. It's holding. Can you imagine if you're, you know, a world leader right now and you got your assistant coming in like, uh, have you seen what's going on on Twitter between Elon and President Trump? All right. So, the expected move would take us to about here. So, we'll see if um and of course, you know, a lot can happen overnight. So, it looks like it beat by a smidge. So, really, it's just going to be their their uh go forward guidance, you know. Man, look at they they found somebody closed a deal at the last minute. 15.8 8 billion uh versus 17 15.79 billion estimate. You know, they're probably like, \"All right, look, I know this contract's 300 grand, but if you sign it today, you can have it for 100 grand because we have got to beat cage fight. They need a cage fight. Matt, that was interesting, too. I I was kind of, you know, I'm kind of a fan of Take Your Kid to Work Day, but that was a little odd. So, no on the Yeah, the two-minute chart is a little, you know, like like you know, smaller time frames, they're a little dicey. I'll show you um let me show you the one that we were looking at today that we did in terms of the trade that we did this morning. So this is the put credit spread from this morning. And if you see, so when I first got in, I got in here when I got that green arrow. So I sold the put credit spread. And then, you know, we're still floundering. So I was probably a little early, but then and it was a little early, but then I don't mind getting a little early because that's the first sign. Then you get the gray. So that's good. Then you get the gray. You get the gray. And then on the slightly higher time frame, the five minutes, you get the green. And that's usually you got that's the turn. So that and what that means is that the momentum to the downside and to support is now loosening up because when it goes it goes pretty quick and then you know boom we actually went pretty quick and we'll go I'll go through these in detail obviously during the class and stuff like that too and it's should be impeached. I mean, you know, it's it's funny. I think in any company, the the number one challenges in in any company is communication. And it's, you know, being able to communicate in a way where you can be transparent, not take things personally, you know, all the things. And and it's amazing that what you see what's happening you know right now on Twitter and you just have like you know two adult men with um you know egos whatever whatever triggers are coming up from their childhoods right their defense mechanisms you know they're totally unconscious and just letting it play out versus like can we just have a conversation. I have worked with a couple of people with with huge egos though and it's just it's not it's not worth it. I mean there's there's good there's healthy egos and then there's you know the classic extreme narcissism and I healthy egos like you know you you got to have a healthy ego if you're going to go out and do stuff but when it borders on narcissism and you can tell you start to it takes a minute but it starts to set in and it's just like get me away from this human. Okay, so right now our iron flies looking pretty good on AVGO. You know, those extreme ones would would expire. I mean, obviously a lot can happen between now and the open. a rift was like this was expected. Can you imagine like people reading about this 100 years from now? And then the Twitter war happened. And from that point on well insane, so it won't be it won't be boring. That's for sure. They are worse than teenage They are worse than teenage girls on Snapchat. Maybe they they both uh they both accidentally ingested too much ketamine today. Or I guess if they were on ketamine they wouldn't really be responding because they wouldn't care. All right, guys. Um well, I think that's a wrap. So, um I will be doing the webinar tonight at 7 on updates on the Momo indicators, you know, of course. And if you do already have it and got it, great. you're first in line for when we release them after the webinar and you can start playing around with it. And of course, Saturday will be the class which will be a lot of fun. And um anyway, should be fun. They're, you know, they're now part of a key part of at least any charts that I'm looking at and always like to find things like that to make things a tad easier. And uh now in in addition to watching my Twitter feed, I want to continue to update the slides for tonight to show some of the action and trade that we did from today. and then uh we'll see what sets up. Never a dull moment. All right, guys. Have a good one. Um see you tonight and then I'm doing the close tomorrow as well. So it should it should be a lot of fun, especially with all this uh uh proverbial [ __ ] show happening. kind of keeps things volatile."
