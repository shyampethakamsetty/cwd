  "transcript": "Hello everybody. My name is Drew Dosk and wow, what a wonderful day. But it didn't start out that way here in the markets. Lots of fireworks happen in the afternoon, but in the morning we had uh jobless claims come in a little bit higher uh than expected as far as um unemployment uh benefits. It came in just slightly higher than expected. Markets didn't like that. They reacted down. Uh the European Central Bank did cut rates. The jobless uh benefits all triggered our Fed to start cutting rates potentially in September. We're going to see tomorrow we have 8:30 a.m. non-farm payroll numbers come out. pay attention to that as well as the response in the market as far as does that change the potential for the Fed to uh to drop rates closer than September in the July meeting which is very close to a possibility and also we got AVGO earnings after hours but hey let's just jump into uh the data we're going to go over a lot of information a lot of volatility occurred today so all right into the market summary page here the Dow Jones is down 022% NASDAQ is down 0.5 57%. S&P 500 down 0.5%. US oil did push up a little higher now up almost 1%. Gold retreated half a percent and Bitcoin is under pressure. There's a major pattern that's developed there on Bitcoin. Going to give you guys a heads up on that here in just a few moments. All right, so now into the broader heat map. We see here on the left hand side of the screen, Microsoft had a decent day. Google as well. Meta basically flat. Oracle up 1.8%. Netflix keeps chugging along, up 1%. Palanteer, big drop here on Palunteer down 7%. Nvidia, Apple both down around 1.2%. But look over here, guys. This is the main story of the day, which really all occurred in the afternoon. We're talking about Tesla. Tesla owner Elon Musk and Trump had a uh Twitter and true social uh battle and uh the result of it was what you see there on the screen, red on the screen. Now, we're going to get into the uh emotions of this and the technicals. This is going to be a great learning lesson for everybody today to understand technical analysis and stay true to that rather than the emotions. All right. So, first up though, let's jump into the S&P. We see here with this move today on this candle. This is a pretty large candle reversing gains that occurred uh yesterday and the day before. So, this candle is not necessarily the best for continued forward momentum to the upside. So, we'll see how this all translates and digests tomorrow, especially with the non-farm payrolls numbers as again released at 8:30 in the morning. To the upside, our resistance is basically there. We're right up against it. 6,11 on the S&P on the bottom side right around 5800. Into the Q's, the Q's too with Tesla falling as much as they did, they were under pressure. Palanteer and Tesla are really pulling down the Q's today. Other tech uh sector uh stocks, some of them did all right. Uh but mainly those bigger players are pulling this index down. Now we flip over to the SMH. SMH very similar occurrence but not as much. It's not as big as a pull down right now. If we continue to move up resistance at $2605, but on the downside I'm watching 23237. That's really the line on the sand to determine if we stay with upward momentum or if we start moving down lower on the SMH into the IWM. IWM putting in a solid day today. Albeit it's down only 0.02%. It's another consolidating move here after breaking out above this declining trend line. So all in all still everything is good for the small cap stocks particularly all the finance stocks there too. So uh watch this price action tomorrow. Let's see if we get a close over this green candle the breakout candle that occurred on Tuesday. And then if we do get a close above there, that means the likelihood that we will move higher in the near to midterm increases. But that also presents a buying opportunity for any pullback down to the trend line. Keep in keep in mind these are all it's a step process. First step, close above this green candle. Second step, buy right down here near the trend line. All right, next up, Bitcoin. All right, big news coming into Bitcoin today, guys. We've been talking about Bitcoin being bearish in the near to midterm for the past about week now as we've had bull a bearish consolidation right here on the daily chart. We flip back over here to the daily chart. You see that bearish cons consolidation that I just mentioned. And then we also have right here this trend line right here that you see that's a very short one. That's the neckline of an head and shoulders pattern right here on the chart. Now, the measured move for that head and shoulders pattern comes all the way down to $94,000. That means this first area of support is vulnerable to be broken, followed by this next area support at 97,500. This one though, I'm very interested because I do think that there could be a lot of buyers right here and potentially even more buyers right here around $94,500. But initially though, what should happen when whenever you break these head and shoulders patterns, we have a drop down underneath the neckline and then usually a reversion back up to the neckline. So this area 102 may very well still hold and push up by the end of the day into tomorrow, potentially into the weekend. It all really depends on the sentiment of the market and the non-farm payrolls will help guide us tomorrow as to what's going to happen in the gold. Gold's still putting in bullish consolidation. It has not yet confirmed above this parallel, but it has not retreated back inside the parallel. So, there's really no play for us to do right here. Support's going to be right here on the top end of the parallel, right around $3,300. Resistance is going to be at the all-time highs, right around $3,500 into silver. Look at this breakout, guys. Look at this. This is awesome stuff. And especially because we get to go through this Monday through Thursday every single week. and going through these levels. It's like a step-by-step process. And as you could see, and if you rewind the clock, go back several days in YouTube and watch some of these earlier videos, I was talking about this potentially happening with silver. And boom, it's right there on the charts in full display, breaking out above the previous pivot high that we had at 34.86. Beautiful move right here. Now, again, with the confirmation, we want to see a confirming move above this candle. If that happens, this area at 34.86 becomes stronger support, creating more pro uh probabilities and increasing those probabilities for a move up there to $38.97 into US oil. US oil, like I said, was basically chopping around today, even though it was up about a 1%. That's the end result is just sideways chop. We've got bullish consolidation, immature, albeit. So, we'll see if we can push higher in the coming days. And we don't have to go that much higher. If we just close around $64, $6410, that will accomplish the confirmation move up above this trend line, which then increases probabilities for that move up to 6869. And that's when you would want to jump in. Since we're so close to this uh trend line, you would want to jump in basically once we get confirmation, but understand price could come back down and test this trend line after confirmation. then you could potentially split up your orders. One order here, another order here. And since it's so close, that won't make a big difference for a swing trade into Nat Gas. NAC gas has been doing its best to fight to stay in this wedge pattern. Today, it is now falling back down to the downside after notice the high end of this uh pivot today on this candle. We got right up to the top end of this wedge and then got rejected and pushed price back down further. So, a close beneath here. Price action could easily close right back in again tomorrow and the next day, but then once we get into next week, uh then we really run out of time for whether we're going to break up or break down. So, looks like we're kicking the can into tomorrow for Nat Gas into the 10-year yield. 10-year yield had a slight pu uh push higher today. Um that's nothing really to write home about as far as changing the pattern for what's going on here on the chart with the 10-year yield. Main thing to watch there is this declining yellow trend line. If we get back above that area, then that will start presenting problems with interest rates moving much higher on the charts into AVGO. Now, AVGO's got earnings today after the bell. And I was hoping by the time I pulled it up, we would start seeing some movement. And we see just it's just barely flickering around where price closed. We closed at $259.93, currently trading at 259.89. So, we'll see if uh earnings comes out in a few moments. If it does, we'll see a lot of price action movement right there. But notice this bull flag pattern measured moves already happened. Next area resistance to the upside should price excel on earnings is right around $28026. First area support's going to be right down here at 250. All right guys, into the story of the day. So this afternoon uh and really the past couple days is is is really when it started. Elon Musk has been putting out tweets on X uh regarding uh this big beautiful bill and how it's going to increase spending and how everybody should kill it. He even put a picture up of one of the actresses in Kill Bill, one of the Hollywood movies uh to try to stimulate um uh advocates or to stimulate interest in folks pushing back on this bill. Uh so he's clearly expressed his disgust with it. Elon Musk has and then Trump started replying and the words were fighting words back and forth back and forth and it just became really nasty. And as you see here on the chart, this price action resulted from it. Now when this happens, this all this when this was going on, I actually was starting to get excited because this move down was purely based on emotions. And if you just keep a clear head and understand that you know what nothing has changed about this company because these two individuals are disagreeing. Now these two individuals are some of the most powerful people in this country and one can argue the world. However, this is this doesn't do anything to this company. All it is is just banter between those two leaders and price action resulted with a lot of people wanting to get out. Now technically speaking, what do we have here on the chart? We've got a time count from this pivot going from the high here on uh Thursday, May 29th down to the lows here on Thursday, June 5th. So, we've got a time count developing indicating to us that the likelihood of a bounce is starting to increase on Tesla. That doesn't mean this is going to be the bottom. There could be more investors that digest this news after hours and into tomorrow that that just don't want to be in this stock. So, I could see Tesla even selling off a little further. And if it does, right, here's the buying opportunity right here on this inclining trend line right around 25476. We'll see if price action gets in there tomorrow. But I think this is an overreaction for sellers in Tesla and we likely will start seeing some support right around here. And if not there, let's go down to this next area which is going to be a major support too. Now that's quite a bit lower right around 208. But as long as you stagger and be prepared as an investor that these things can go much further than you anticipate when emotions are involved, then that way you keep a clean head, get your average in correctly so that when this dust settles, the bounce will occur and you can reap some fantastic profits from this stuff. This sort of move, I just love this in trading, especially with day trading, too. As you see here, when price came down, it blew through this gap fill, this gap fill, and then also it pierced this final gap fill, this red candle, but then caught support right here, bouncing up from 274, and it was all the way up at 287. So, a $13 increase in bounce. We'll flip to the 10-minute just so you can get an idea. And look at this. Look at the sheer volume right here, too, with folks wanting to get out. And this was a waterfall slide. This was a nasty slide here on the charts. But albeit it is fantastic to see 10 bars straight down. You see that 1, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 bars straight down and then received a bounce all the way up here. Even higher than what I said it was at 288. So that bounce just from the lows right there is a good five and a half% on the stock of Tesla. Incredible action and that really what drove a lot of price lower on the other indices. You know, when you have such big movement in one stock like this, one that has a large market cap, that can start pulling down prices in the S&P 500, which is why the S&P 500 was down half a percent like we saw earlier today into Microsoft into a stock that had a great day. It had another all-time high. You can see over here we had a high pivot 46835 highlighted that resistance area right here. Price action pierced above it during price or during trading hours today, intraday. You can see we came up, got rejected, and then went up again, poked above for about an hour, then sold off, then made another attempt before the end of the day. All all while this was going on, and Microsoft was continuing trying to push above and close at new all-time highs. We had that huge Tesla sell-off going on. So, that still says there's a lot of individuals that are interested in Microsoft to continue to go higher. I think that's incredible considering the extended move that it's already on. This stock needs to cool off and come back down if you want it to eventually go higher. Otherwise, we're going to be looking at a pretty significant fall off after investors really start taking profit from this tremendous move up. Should we continue higher? Right up here is where I'm targeting for a short at 48441. Support area down here at 441. That would imply a drop roughly around 40 bucks should it tag that area and pull back down to the parallel which is a pretty big high probability. All right, into Google now. Google uh completely different chart than what we see here on Microsoft. Microsoft brand new all-time highs. Google not anywhere close to their all-time highs. And notice here too, price action came today trying to get back into this parallel channel. And if you recall, I mentioned this the other day on Monday that we never confirmed into this parallel channel. So Google really has been struggling to push higher on the chart as is evident today also. So what I would be doing is absolutely nothing with Google right now. Google looks like it could break up, but it also looks like it's struggling to do so and could potentially start faltering especially if the bigger markets start pulling back too. And also keep in mind guys, we do have a new cycle date coming up on June 15th. So that June 15th cycle date will have a lot of positive and also a lot of negative sentiment with it. So what I expect is a lot of chop action and not necessarily the current cycle that we're in right now which is more neutral to slightly bullish. This cycle should be big heavyweights battling up and down and up and down and eventually at the end of a heavyweight battle there will be a winner. So we I don't know which direction that will go. We're going to have to let the charts help us, guide us, tell us where the probabilities lie for the move. So, back into Google right now, I really wouldn't be doing anything. If you want to at the very earliest, the buying area would be right here on this trend line currently around 1650. Major support's going to be down here around 146 under the $150 area. But there could be some stops along the way right around gap fills if price on Google continues lower into Palunteer. You can see here Palanteer is starting to finally crack. Now, it's almost about time because this chart also was kind of like Microsoft with its incredible move up where it's just moved here from $65 all the way over $130. Basically almost 100% increase. So, if I go back on the charts of Palunteer, you see here from this pivot high back in January of 2021. All I had to do was string that over to the most recent high pivot, which is here occurred in February of this year, and then continued that trend line on. And you can see that price never got above and confirmed above that trend line. Now, this other trend line I drew just to gauge where price could go after creating this pivot. And then look at how wonderful technical analysis works. Price here just the other day on Tuesday went exactly up to this trend line before reversing back down on Palunteer. Now the next major area of support is going to be at 108.86. Now, should that area break, this next area on the top end of the parallel at 9764, that zone right there should be a great area to accumulate some palunteer for further upward momentum, especially with all the government contracts that they have secured into FSLR. FSLR is now on breakout watch. And if you go back here further on the chart, you can see we're well off the most recent high area right here at uh from 2024. that is because if you go back further, there really isn't anything to go off of further back on the charts. But this high pivot that we have in June of 24 has allowed us to create this declining trend line where we see price attempted to break above on this occasion right here in May 13th and it never confirmed with a breakout above. So now the test is can we confirm this breakout. Notice the difference between the breakouts. Also, when this stock price broke out of this trend line, look how high it went. This also creates a a a larger difficulty for price to confirm. Since price moved so far above the trend line, it's going to have to move even higher to confirm, and it didn't do that. So, when it didn't confirm, we were vulnerable for a breakdown underneath this trend line, which definitely occurred. Now we got support right here off of this trend line from pivot to pivot. Price came tagged it perfectly and pushed higher. Now we've confir Now we've moved higher. Now we need to confirm higher. If once we confirm higher, then this trend line becomes support and next resistance will be up here at 18922. All right, man. Guys, I am so excited to trade tomorrow. I'm sure there still should be some fireworks. Again, I know I've already said it twice, but I'm going to say it the third time. non-farm payrolls uh come out tomorrow for job uh job reports for the previous month of May. So, we need to follow that. That will help guide us for price action moving forward. We don't have a trading close tomorrow. I'm going to be back on Monday. Thank you guys for tuning in. I'm going to see you guys on the charts then and uh get you some new trade setups. All right, have a great weekend. [Music]"
