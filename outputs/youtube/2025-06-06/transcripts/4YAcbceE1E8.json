  "title": "Blockchain is the future of currency, expert says",
  "transcript": "So, Bitcoin is, as you may see, has uh breached the $111,000 mark, and that means that people have confidence in this blockchain technology. Bitcoin being the grandfather of it all. And so, I do think that Bitcoin is going to be set for a longer term upside. And that's, you know, I don't know that the minations back and forth. It might retrench back and then uh go back over 100,000 again. If it does retrench back, it's the similar situation as gold. When equities and bonds and money supply constricts, people will create liquidation events and sometimes that will be Bitcoin that they will liquidate for whatever capital raise reasons. So, don't get concerned about the girrations, especially through the summer when we're going through tariff negotiation and you'll see uh trade deals being announced and you'll see a gy rate. The future of currency is blockchain. It absolutely is. Whether it's central bank digital blockchain currency or it is you know privatized bitcoin ethereum and all of the others blockchain dogecoin blockchain technology it doesn't really matter it's on the blockchain it is the future and it is going to be the end of fiat currency eventually which means our entire banking system will have to change and a lot of things will be different but this is the future and bitcoin is the grandfather and so I think that yeah bitcoin is going to to have a nice long run um but it will gyate down and and forth just like gold when when there are liquidity based events."
