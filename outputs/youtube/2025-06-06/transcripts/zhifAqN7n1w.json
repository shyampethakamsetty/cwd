  "title": "Cracker Barrel's lows were a buying opportunity, I hope you took my advice, says Jim Cramer",
  "transcript": "All right. What the heck just happened to the stock of Cracker Barrel? I've been following this folksy offhighway restaurant/ retail chain for a little over a year and I started pounding the table on the stock last July after speaking to CEO Julie Msino. My thing is orchestrating just one heck of a turnaround. Initially, the stock had a fantastic run climbing from the mid-30s last September to the mid60s by the end of January. Of course, once Wall Street started worrying about the impending tariffs and the possibility of a recession, the stock rolled over, especially after liberation day and its April lows. It came all the way back down to 33 bucks. Now, I told you that was an incredible buying opportunity. Bye. I hope you took my advice because Cracker Barrel is now up 38% since I last recommended it in April, climbing back to the mid-50s even after it got hit today. So, this has been a big winner for us. But this morning, Cracker Barrel reported and Wall Street clearly didn't like what it saw. That's why the stock tumbled over 7% today. I think it was a solid quarter and the market's overreacting because Cracker Barrels run so much over the past couple months. Well, let me tell you why. Don't miss a second of MadMoney.
