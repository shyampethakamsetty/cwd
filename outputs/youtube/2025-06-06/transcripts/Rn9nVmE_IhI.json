  "title": "CANDLE CLUES: Spotting Bearish Engulfing Patterns",
  "transcript": "If a candle's trying to tell me that, you know, a big gray bar for continuation and then the next candle is a bearish engulfing candle on that, then I'm going to short the out of that. And uh because that's, you know, it's telling me that the bears are in control. They just bearish engulfed a strong candle, you know. So, I just kind of look for stuff like that. you know, if it's if that bullish candle again had another one follow it in the in that direction, then I would I would look for a pullback on that to keep going long with it. But if it pulls a reversal and cancels out, for lack of better words, cancels a a bullish candle like that, then then I'd start looking short. Okay, so that makes sense. And vice versa. In addition to the support and resistance, then you're doing a little bit of uh candle analysis as well. then. Yep. Yep. Mainly engulfing candles or are there other styles you're looking for? No, just anything in general. Uh, you know, I just try to try to have a good mind for different kind of patterns and stuff that candles put out there. Yep. Uh, like a big one is the fractals that uh you know, if it's they're they're generally the sign of a reversal. So quite often on trend days, if they're trending up, you'll have a red fractal at the top, it's supposed to signify a pullback. And uh on trend days, those red fractals would just get run over and canceled out. And it's just telling you again that the b the market is strong. You know, the bulls are strong, the bulls are in control. So just keeping So what what's your goal over the next year or so? Are you hoping to kind of scale up from here, get to live accounts, or are you just going to keep trading prop? What's the What's the next mission? I haven't gotten that far yet, I guess. Okay. I'd like to uh I'd like to just keep it going. Uh my my main goal is probably just to keep working on my discipline to uh to blow less accounts and hold them longer while maintaining payouts instead of instead of uh burning through accounts as bad as I did in April and in uh March and April. So nobody likes doing that. Getting on the larger accounts helps because you have a lot more draw down um uh room and wiggle room, but obviously trading less helps as well, right? Yep. Yep. Have you considered sizing down or do you feel like the size you're at right now still makes sense? Um sizing down in what regard? Like you could trade the micros instead of the NQ and take a little less take a little bit longer to get to each prof profit"
