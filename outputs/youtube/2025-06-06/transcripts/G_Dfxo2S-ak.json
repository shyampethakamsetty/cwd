  "title": "How Nvidia Is Grappling With Trump's AI Chip Ban On China",
  "transcript": "In the crosshairs of the Trump administration's trade war with China is Nvidia, a top AI chip maker and one of the most widely owned AI stocks. Washington's export controls are restricting sales on Nvidia's high-tech chips to one of the largest economies in the world, hitting revenue hard, and forcing the multi-trillion dollar company to rethink its strategy. The $50 billion China market is effectively closed to US industry. As a result, we are taking a multi-billion dollar writeoff on inventory that cannot be sold or repurposed. Nvidia CEO Jensen Hang expects China's growing AI market to reach $50 billion in the next two to three years, but that market is off limits to Nvidia because of US export controls on AI chips to China. Nvidia's CEO told CNBC that losing access to China's AI market comes at a significant cost. China is a very large market. It's probably going to be a $50 billion AI market in a couple of two, three years. It would be a tremendous loss not to be able to address it as an American company. It's going to bring back revenues. It's going to bring back taxes. It's going to create lots of jobs here in the United States. The Trump administration effectively barred Nvidia from selling AI chips to China in midappril due to security concerns. The move prevents the company from selling its H20 chips, resulting in 10.5 billion dollars in sales loss. The H20 chip was specifically designed for the Chinese market to comply with previous export restrictions on China. But due to rules from the Trump administration, Nvidia said it was left with $4.5 billion dollar in inventory it's not able to sell. In an interview on May 19th, Nvidia CEO called the H20 chip ban deeply painful and said the US will lose billions in tax revenue due to the ban, adding that the company is losing 15 billion dollars in potential sales due to these rules. The US has restricted exports of Nvidia's most sophisticated ships to China since 2022, both to address potential concerns about those ships being used in China's military and to keep the US's edge in technology. But Trump removed one export control in midMay, standing in the way for Nvidia, ending the Biden era AI diffusion rule. Critics call that rule overly complicated and burdensome. And Nvidia CEO says that rule accelerated China's AI development rather than slowing it down. Shielding Chinese chip makers from US competition only strengthens them abroad and weakens America's position. Export restrictions have spurred China's innovation in scale. The US has based its policy on the assumption that China cannot make AI chips. That assumption was always questionable and now it's clearly wrong. Nvidia's market share in China was about 95% four years ago. It's about 50% today. And Nvidia's rivals stand to benefit from the ongoing export controls. Domestic AI companies in China like Huawei are cashing in and experts point to Huawei as a clear leader in China's race to find an Nvidia replacement. But Wong remains optimistic about Trump's decision-making in the technology sector. President Trump wants US tech to lead. The deals he announced are wins for America, creating jobs, advancing infrastructure, generating tax revenue, and reducing the US trade deficit. Now, in response to the export controls, the company is creating a new chip designed specifically for China and focusing on alternative markets. According to Reuters, Nvidia is planning to release a downgraded version of that H20 chip for China to be released in July. Nvidia is diversifying its manufacturing presence as well. And in April, Huang announced plans to commit 500 billion dollars to build factories in the US over the next four years. And the multi-trillion dollar chipmaking company announced an agreement with Saudi Arabia in midMay to sell hundreds of thousands of AI chips as Nvidia looks to diversify beyond China. This comes after Trump's $600 billion Middle East tour. Nvidia CEO has a clear message. If the US does not change its current rules on export controls on AI chips, it could lose its dominance and control over the global AI rollout. China's right behind us. I mean, they're we're very very close. Uh it but remember this is a long-term this is an infinite race. The AI race is not just about chips. It's about which stack the world runs on.
