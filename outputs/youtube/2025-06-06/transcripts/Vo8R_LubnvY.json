  "transcript": "You know, you can learn a lot about a market from looking at the stocks that make it to the 52- week high list. It's a rarified group by nature, and it speaks loudly about what works and of course what doesn't. So, on a day where the Dow slipped 108 points, S&P declined 53% and the Nasdaq lost 83%. Most of that decline occurring in the second half of a tumultuous session. I want to interpret what the market is saying for you. That way, you can make your own judgments. Let's use yesterday's list. It's more informative and shows you some real themes that I think have staying power despite today's ugly action. First, it's probably not that surprising, but there's no real tech on the 52- week high list these days. President Trump had what he called a successful call with President Xi, and they talked about getting together. We heard that rare earth minerals were discussed, something China has a near monopoly on. I understand that we're now facing some auto factory closures because we don't have enough rare earth magnets here. They're made in China. We didn't build cars. We got a momentary bump up for tech, but it was ephemeral. Tech came apart as quickly as it came together because without a deal with China, the group could remain under pressure for some time, even as there are tons of individual stocks in the tech group that have nothing to do with China. It's important to realize though that tech's not well represented in the 52- week hot list. In fact, there was only one big one. That's Brocom, which reported a small top and bottom line beat after the close with solid guidance for the current quarter. But the stock is just getting hammered in after hours trading. Now, I think the stock simply came in too hot given how much it's run for the Apple lows. I'm not buying the bare case, which is based on some narrower margins on custommade chips that it does. It's just that tech stocks are under pressure and Broadcom wouldn't be spared today, whether it reported or not, and people should recognize that instead of freaking out. It's up 12% for the year.
