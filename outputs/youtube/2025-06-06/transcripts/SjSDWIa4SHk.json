  "title": "SPX Premarket Prep (5-Minutes): Options Market Analysis | 06.05.25",
  "transcript": "Hello traders, this is Michael coming to you from Game Edge on Thursday, June 5th with our five minute pre-market morning prep. Uh, as always here at Game Edge, we start with our three pillars, sentiment, structure, and trend. Currently starting with our market trend model is based on the tick index. You can research that your favorite investing website. Uh, the quick TLDDR takeaway of this is this is an overall look of buying versus selling in the market. Uh, this bolded white line is our intraday instantaneous CT. uh if it is from lower left to upper right, this is indicating that more buyers are in the overall market than sellers. And then our colored ribbon down here is our longerterm look back period uh for longerterm positioning in the market. Again, if the red is above scan and with a positive slope, that is indicating that there are more buyers versus sellers in the overall market. Breath indicator, new highs versus new lows. Uh green line obviously above the red line indicating more stocks are being bought than sold. Our filter cumulative tick this cyan line this is larger institutional orders plus 1,000 minus 1,000 uh block orders indicating we were above zero yesterday so institutions were involved we did see a slight downturn in the instantaneous CT towards the end of the day indicating we might have seen a little bit of weakness and selling into the close but the overall cumulative tick was above zero uh and rising indicating more buying versus selling. Moving on to our SPXA. This is our cruise ship. Longer term uh less uh less turned over expiry contracts as denoted over here. Uh again call dominated above below spot price completely green net delta across the board in the structure and sentiment. So that is obviously extremely bullish uh from that aspect of our spa uh 40,000 foot view cruise ship view. Moving on to the SPXP. These are shorter dur duration uh contracts that turn over daily weekly. Uh we are call dominated above and below spot price. Again indicating that uh uh uh market uh speculators uh call uh speculators are in control of the overall structure. Uh we do have our transitions labeled here. GEX and DEX transition. Uh we did close within the DEX transition yesterday but above the GEX transition. So again still bullish across the board as we are call dominated uh above and below spot price. You'll denote these gradients here 6,6050 and 6100 to the upside. uh extreme out of the money call speculation continues. So more than likely price appreciation to the upside will continue and any pullback will be dampened volatility pull back down towards these levels will be an opportunity to get involved in the overall market. Moving on to the um the um S&P uh sorry uh SPX um gex ratio uh again indicating a slight drop in sentiment here. Uh this is shorted durated call uh gamma uh leaving the overall complex. So just slight weakness. We are above that one uh which indicates that call speculators are still in control. So just uh looking at short um duration possible weakness uh but again just an overall pullback within a strong uptrend and bullish sentiment and structure in the overall market. Uh moving on to the S&P delta balance. Again, separating each individual plane, we denote the right-h hand plane, which is that out of the money call speculation dropping slightly below zero. So, slight weakness in that call speculation to the upside uh may limit overall price appreciation. Delta balance and the lefth hand plane staying uh towards a one. So, again indicating that strong uh support below us uh via in the money calls. Uh delta balance slightly dropping. So, again short short duration weakness may be entering the overall market. So we may be entering a place where we see a short pullback in spot price. Um SPXP's zero DTE again expiry up here. Couple circles denoted here. NetGX is uh very low for today. So this easily could slip negative depending on what the intraday volume command is telling us. Uh so again that could be indicating that we have some short-term weakness. Uh GEX index transition um very um unambiguous here uh with our levels. So again, staying above these transition levels will lean a little bit more bullish for a move toward the upside to the down being below these levels, uh, we'd anticipate a little bit more weakness down towards 5950. If we get below 5950, this may be an opportunity to short for a little bit more weakness into this in the money call dominated environment. Again, probably not a large move down. We see that 5900 level to the downside. That would be an area that most likely we would see some pausing. Uh this first uh step would be the 5950 and then 5925 and 5900 to the downside. Again, staying above transition, we'd look for a move back up towards that 6,000 level. Uh again, noise floor we've talked about call dominated above and below spot price. Uh lowi heading in today. So we'll be at the mercy of the zero DTE uh speculator. So we'll uh volume command will be an integral tool to watch today uh for uh positioning uh via the uh options market. Net stag command high sensitivity strikes. We've already laid that out. We have in the money calls at 5,900 that are the largest integral here and in the money puts at 6060 above us. Obviously, significant level uh above us. Uh so again, this is what we call a locked horns look. Um, so we'll just most likely be transitioning or sorry uh chopping between those uh transition levels uh with not a a lot of um uh price movement unless we see a significant move in the volume command as well as uh uh structure uh coming in uh for the upside or the downside. So we'll continue to watch that intraday. Um that's all I have for this morning. A quick fivem minute overview of our sentiment structure and trend. Uh last uh summary takeaway is we have bullish structure across SPXA, SPXP. We have very well- definfined transition levels that if we're above will be bullish. If we're below, we might see a little bit more pullback and weakness. Couple opportunities there for trades. Again, low OI for today. So, we'll be at the mercy of the ZDT positioning. That's all I have for today. Thanks everybody and we'll see you later."
