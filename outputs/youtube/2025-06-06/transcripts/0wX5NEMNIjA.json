  "title": "HOW TO FIND STOCKS! ðŸ‘€ðŸ“Š",
  "transcript": "Ross, how do you find these big percentage movers each day? You found the one stock in the entire market that went up 700% while every other stock was, you know, choppy. That's like finding a needle in the hay stack. How do you do it? Well, you need a system. And so the system is understanding the type of stock more likely to make that move, the profile of that stock. And then once you know the profile, how do you find it in real time in the very beginning of the move? And so what I'm looking for is a stock between a dollar and 20 that's up 10% that has five times higher volume today than its 50-day average and that has a news event. These are four characteristics of demand."
