  "transcript": "Dividends are the You ever meet an old person who's like, \"I live off my dividends.\" Yeah, they live off their dividends. Whenever I make these dividend videos, some smartass on TikTok is like, \"Dividends are so stupid. Just get a high yield savings account for 3%.\" Shut up. When you're young, you definitely want to be heavily in technology stocks, like disproportionately so. But that doesn't mean that you don't have any dividend stocks. Your grandparents didn't just buy dividend stocks the day they turned 60, dumbass. They've been investing in that for decades, compounding, reinvesting the dividends slowly over time. When you start, you're going to have like, I don't know, a 100 shares of some dividend stock. And when that first dividend hits your account and it's like $12, you're going to be like, \"What the fuck?\" Don't lose sight of the long term. Focus on the long term. Don't look at the $12 and go, \"Well, this is a waste of my time. It's going to compound and grow and grow and grow over decades, and then one day you'll be living off of your dividends.\" I'm going to show you a dividend finding hack right now cuz I know your follow-up question. I don't know any good dividend stocks. I don't know how to find dividend stocks. So, let's go. This is CHD. It is largely viewed as the best dividend ETF on the market. And you can see that it pays an annual dividend of around 3.93% or $14 per share. Just because I said that a lot of people consider it to be the best doesn't mean you just run out and buy it. You got to do some research first cuz there's lots of dividend ETFs. And I know your follow-up question. Can you show us a list of them? They're going to be in this playlist right down here. But I said I had a hack and just showing you one ETF. That isn't a hack. So, if you're the type of person who's sitting there going, \"Gee, I just don't know how to find dividend paying companies.\" Look at a dividend ETF's top 10 holdings, and you will get some ideas. Hey, you might recognize some of these companies. And I don't think I have to say this, but a lot of people aren't always using this thing up here. This works for every kind of ETF. So, if you hear someone on Tik Tok saying, \"Invest in artificial intelligence stocks or invest in robotics or invest in clean energy and you go, I just don't know how to find them, look at the top 10 holdings of these ETFs. But I don't know how to find the ETFs.\" Okay, fine. Look, it's really easy. Just type in anything. I just typed in robotics ETFs. You can type in artificial intelligence. You can type in clean energy. You can type in green energy. You can type in all kinds of stuff. plus the word ETF and you'll get yourself a little list. If you're the type of investor who doesn't like to mess with individual stocks, you think it's too scary, you think it's too research intensive, you don't want to be bothered, then don't. Do what works for you. Maybe ETFs are a better choice for you. Hit that follow. Thanks for watching. See you later."
