  "transcript": "Hello again everyone. Welcome back. This is a market wrapup for the week ending Friday, June 6. Let's start off here with the ETF dashboard. In the index ETFs, everything was positive. The most positive was the Russell 2000. So, all of a sudden, it's coming to life. But, you know, the move that it made wasn't all that spectacular. Although it was up 3.3%. Everything was positive. Over here on the year-to- date though, it is the only one that is negative. The Dow is back into positive territory. The Q's continue to lead on the year. When we look at the 16 sectors that I track every week, okay, we're back to 13 up and three down just like the prior week. So, we've had backtoback strength in here. And uh and now we've gone from eight up and eight down uh on year to date to a little bit more positive with 10 positive and and six negative. The leader to the upside for the week was semiconductors 5.4%. So pretty strong little bounce in here. And then the consumer staples were the weakest year to date. Home construction continues to be way way down in in the tank down minus 12.3%. And I think they're going to have to to get the home builders turn around. We're going to have to get interest rates dropping. Uh and and I don't know when that's going to happen. We'll see. Um, and then XLI continues to be the leader of the upside. It's been strength showing here now for weeks and weeks, up 10% on the year. Okay, that's where we sit with the ETF dashboard for this week. Let's take a look at the Dow Diamonds. So, on Friday, the Dow Diamonds were up 441. The Dow Industrials were up like 4 and what was the actual number? 443 points. So, it just we had this range that it had been in and it just kind of stuck its head above there and then duck back down. Uh, so I wouldn't call that a breakout of any kind in my mind. It looks kind of weak uh for the week. It was up $553. You know, it did push above that uh the week of May 18th, which we'd had an inside candle, you know, last week and then, you know, now we're breaking above that high. So, that's a little bit of a positive. We'll see what kind of strength we continue to get in there. Let's take a look at the SPY. Now, this is interesting. Up $69 on Friday and up $975 for the week. So, again, you know, breaking out in here prior weeks high, you know, going above the the previous week's highs, although we had that inside candle here the week before last. uh this nice move, but when I look at the daily, it gives me pause. Okay, so here's what I noted to my members uh during the week. Uh on Wednesday, we had this very, very compressed day, and it was the most compressed day. I went back and checked every one of these days, this was more compressed. in between the range between high and low for the day, you have to go back to right here on February 14th to get a day that's tighter than what occurred this last Wednesday. And notice how after that February 14th, we had two more days where we kind of pushed a little bit higher and then that was it and it rolled over and broke down. Well, we've had two more days of pushing a little bit higher and then we get this dogey little dogey type candle for Friday. We'll see what happens. So, the Elliot wave count that I've got on here is this. I have moved to what I was holding as the alternate count. Uh, so let me go to the the weekly here. That might help a little bit better. Okay, let me do this. So, I was thinking because of this zigzag for wave two that we were going to get a a more of a sideways development in here and have like a wxy. But when I started looking at this more and more, I started thinking, well, you know, we actually did get a flat, which is kind of considered to be a sideways move, even though we got a deep C wave down because we had an A B came back up beyond the beginning of the wave A. And so I just said, okay, I'm going to move to this count for a fourth wave, and then we'll see. And I'll hold the alternate as this is a W. Okay. So, right now I'm looking at this as one, two, and these are just linked together. It's just kind of a a path forward right now. So, what I'm focusing on is is wave one done? Where are we? So, when I look at this and I think, well, here's here's what looks like one, two, three to me and then possibly four, although it's a very very shallow wave four when you talk about four as a percent of three. So my target typically for like a wave four is down here at 38.2. Now it has satisfied a minimum of 23.6. But if we continue to come down, this would be my first target down here around 563 on the spy. And we may go deeper. I mean it could also the other possibility is we continue to flush out a little bit more. this wave four holds here and then we get into a much deeper wave two to correct this first wave. So, those are the things I'm watching for right now. I think this is suspect and it's suspect because we're starting to see, you know, we're seeing divergence show up, not confirming the price action move in here. Okay, so that's where we sit with the spy. Let's take a look at the cues. Okay, the Q's on Friday. Talk about tight little dogee candle up 5.13. Great. Yeah, we closed on Thursday here and we gapped up and didn't go anywhere. I mean, the range high to low $359 on the cues. Nothing. I mean, we're up into that, you know, I've got it labeled as somewhat of a a resistance zone because this is where it basically traded from mid December to midFebruary in here. And that's right where we are. We're right up into that mix. And so I we're getting the same kind of divergences showing up. And so watching for this to roll over and start to break down also. But we need to start to see the price action, you know, get below the 10day moving average and start to roll over like it did back here in February. Okay. So, hasn't quite done that yet. Uh let's take a look at IWM. This was up $3.37. So, here's the here's the move for this last week. You can see, let me show you the weekly view. Up 683. So, this is the move that generated the 3 point something percent move on the dashboard that said, okay, it was the biggest percentage mover of the four. Okay, so that's that's what we're looking at here. But then when you look at what happened on Friday, it's just like, well, this doesn't look super strong. I mean, the volume dropped off from Thursday and we'll see what kind of followthrough we get. I'm actually expecting this wave two. I've got it labeled as one and two. I'm expecting this to roll over and break down. Uh we started to get some of that back over in here, but we didn't get any follow through. Uh so that's what we're watching here on IWM. Now again, this has been really the weakest one amongst all the major indices. So, I just I was trying to get bullish on it, but right now I just struggle with that. Okay, so let's take a look at um Oh, I know. I had a couple things I wanted to show you back about the spy. Let me let me show you. Let's go back to this and let me show you this tweet I came across or post, whatever you want to call it that Zven Hinrich if you pronounce it that Henrik uh put out and he's talking about all the unfilled gaps in the S&P. Now what he's showing you here when you drill in and blow up and look at the chart it's a 15minute chart of the S&P since the April lows. So he's saying look these are all unfilled gaps. Now another view of that that I've ch that I've shared with my members is this view okay is looking at the E- mini S&P 500 futures that trade. This is an hourly chart. Okay so the dark shading is the during the day session. The light gray in here the gray is the overnight session. The market has a tendency, it's not a rule, it doesn't have to do this, but it has a tendency to tag overnight lows and overnight highs. Sometimes it does it the next day, sometimes it takes days, sometimes it takes weeks. These are all the overnight lows that I've identified since early April that have not been tagged yet during the day. Okay? So really keeping an eye on this. But what's interesting is it kind of syncs up with what's going on with the open gaps that are occurring also. And again, there's no rule that says gaps have to be filled. It's a tendency for the market to go back and and fill the gaps and and uh you know, like they the gaps have a tendency to attract just like like magnets, let's say. Okay. But sometimes it takes days, sometimes it takes weeks or even longer. So that's the picture where we sit with the S&P. I want to take a look at a couple of the commodities, but let's start off with the Bloomberg commodity index. And I want to show you what's going on with that. And here's what I what I show the members is this. So this is a weekly view of the Bloomberg commodity index. It was up $3.32 this week after last week looking like, you know, they're pulling the rug out from underneath it. It just totally reversed, gapped up at the open this week and just pushed higher. This is the highest close since the the week of March 23rd in here. It looks like it's trying to get above all this congestion, sideways type move that we've been in really for what, two, four, six, about eight weeks or so. Okay, so this is an interesting picture. This is the key area that it's got to get above to have an indication that commodities are really taking off. So, we'll be watching that. Here's the longer term picture of the Bloomberg Commodity Index. This is all the data I've got back into 2001. So, you can see long-term trend was broken back here at the end of 2020 going into 2021. had a big strong move. We've pulled back. It looks like we're trying to get a turn going in here, but we got to get above that resistance area in order to make that happen. All right, so that's the overall Bloomberg commodity index. Let's take a look at what WTI is, West Texas Intermediate. Here we go for the week. Up $3.79. Okay, so this is what I'm looking at in here. And this is what we're watching to see is this low going to hold and this continue to push. Right now it looks like it wants to do that. Okay. So that's that's uh oil. Now let's take a look at silver and then I'm going to look at gold quickly. Let me start off with SLV. Let me go here to the weekly view. Had a really strong week this week. Up $2.36 $269. On Friday it was up 24. So just a little continued push in here after having that really nice breakout. Had a had a big move on on Monday. Then we just compressed Tuesday, Wednesday, then a continuation on a big gap up on Thursday and very very nice move this week. Okay, so here's the picture. What I'm continuing to hold is a bullish count. I think we're in a third wave and thirds of thirds actually. Continue to work our way up and we're getting a breakout. This looks like a really nice swing move to the upside. You know, we are at like 12 uh let's see 12 year highs, I believe. 12 1 half year highs back to 2012 and the prior high was like $48 in 2011. So, if this continues to push, this is going to be really really interesting picture. All right, let me go and take a look at GLD and then I'm going to show you the comparison between the two. All right. So, GLD down $4.15 on Friday, up $1.58 for the week. So, we continue to struggle since the high on April 22nd. I'm still holding the the bull count. I'm still thinking that we've got more to go to to flesh out a fivewave move and complete the the sequence that we're in. So, we'll see how much longer we go. We'll see if we can continue to push to the upside. All right. So, that is gold and let me go. What I want to show you is the comparison in here between gold and silver when I overlap them. And let me scroll out a little bit. Take the bigger view. What's interesting is silver has been clearly lagging GLD. Okay. SLV has been clearly lagging GLD. It did the same thing for a while back over here in 2010, 2011. Just kind of hanging back, hanging there. So, it could be interesting. We get up to $48. We're at 3269 here on SLV and 30518 here on uh on GLD. Um, all right. So, that's the interesting comparison between the two. It's been pretty obvious that SLV has been kind of lagging. If it plays catchup, could be a nice trade. All right, that's it for this weekend. If you felt like the video was helpful, give it a thumbs up.
