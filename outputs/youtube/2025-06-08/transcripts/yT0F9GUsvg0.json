  "title": "Next 10X Stock? Mind-Blowing Short Squeeze Chart Setup You Need to See! | Stock Market Analysis",
  "transcript": "Hello guys, welcome back. So my friends, in this video I show you here ticker GoPro, ticker symbol is GPRO trading on the NASDAQ. I think everybody knows the company what they're doing. And yeah, we have here uh maybe a potential 10 uh 10x stock guys or 10 beggger. This ticker here can force a massive squeeze. I will show you here all the price levels. And I also want to show you what happened since I made my first video release on GoPro. You can see that video guys and I mentioned already that we have here a very strong buying algo demand zone where I expect the price to go before we see a potential algo squeeze breakout or short squeeze. This is not financial advice but I show you here all my price levels and we make a quick recap now what happened since my video release. Yeah, guys, uh before we zoom out here in the chart, um this ticker got my attention because we have here a very very strong technical setup and as I mentioned before, even a breakout or short squeeze potential. This is what I'm doing. I'm scanning the market here for potential breakout stocks and I always want to buy them before they squeeze. I never fo into stocks and I also don't recommend to do that. So, what I spotted here is this blue box, guys. this price level here between 75 cents and 50 cents. When GoPro GoPro got my attention, we traded here still at 90 cents. And I said that I expect the price to touch this trend channel bottom here or 50 cents and all right, both is of course possible here before we see a potential algo breakout and maybe that can lead into a short squeeze. So let's simulate here with trading what happened after my video release. Here we go. Oh, I'm sorry guys. That was not intentional. I have some very nice app here. Okay, guys. So, here we go. Oh, it's not a sad thing. It's a lucky thing. And yeah, we can see that GoPro started to squeeze, guys. Exactly as I said, the bottom was in. Why did we saw that dip guys? That was here at the 8th and 9th of April when the whole market tanked down. Every stock guys in the market tanked down here at the 7th of April. So, the liquidity zone which I measured for GoPro was in. I was right with that. That was here only a market fake out and what you can see right now that GoPro started to rebound here 108%. So congratulations to everybody who saw my videos here and yeah maybe took the chance to buy in. I don't give you here any financial advisers but this is what we have now here based on the chart. Why I'm telling you this guys um I never say FOMO in guys. This is very dangerous to FOMO into stocks because I always spot the market for short squeeze or breakout stocks and I released my brand new video right now. So, what I'm doing is I post on Patreon my yeah, let's call it um personal finest collection of breakout stocks and I always release them during the week and especially during the weekends. I have my finest selection, my so-called hot stocks and the brand new video is available right now on Patreon. So what I usually doing, same like for GoPro, I mention where I expect the price to go before a short squeeze happens that my members have enough time to review the chart. Yeah, make their own decisions if they want to buy in or not. Yeah, that is very important that you make your own due diligence. But I always identify the buyin price levels, this blue zone, same like for GoPro and the exit price levels. And you can see that this stock here touched exactly this buyin price range here before we touched the exit price level and we squeezed 140% 4 days after my video prediction guys. Very important. So if you want to see that content the actual brand new videos out right now. We also had here a couple of short squeezes in the past weeks. It's always the same setup guys. It doesn't matter if we talk about GoPro or other or the other stocks. This is always in the same way. So, if you want to join in guys, we have here the full package membership on Patreon, which is my most popular membership where you get access to all my short squeeze stocks. And I also have here trading tutorials available. So, if you don't know how to trade, yeah, which ticker, which um indicator should you use? Yeah, which broker should you use? I have everything available here on Patreon. I answer these questions and have a lot of tutorials also for advanced traders. The link patreon.com/back black belt trader is also available here in the video description. Yeah guys, what is next for GoPro? Is it now too late to buy in or not? Well, so as I said, I would not for in here even if we are still in the buying liquidity zone. But what we have right now here is also this kind of trend channel pattern. It is very possible that the bottom is in since as I said that was a market shakeout. My technical bottom for GoPro is 50 cents. This is what I measured and that also was the bottom here besides this fake out. And we see this candle wick here. So more or less the stock found support at 46 cent before we had the small squeeze reaction. But we are still in this trend channel pattern here and that means that GoPro might get rejected now here in the 85 cent range. The bearish market makers here as the balance sheet for GoPro is not doing well. I think they had an market or a a cash on hand of $555 million that was in 2023. Now it's just $151 million that was reported by the end of 2024. So they're losing a lot of money, guys. This is not a profitable company right now. But guys, that is the problem with trading. You don't need to be profitable to force a short squeeze. We have here some short squeeze price levels or bullish breakout price levels for GoPro. So I could extend this here a little bit more. We have $250 as a short squeeze trigger. And if you have not seen my previous videos, guys, I honestly expect that GoPro will come back to this price range here between $250 and $2.94 if we can break out here out of this bullish demand zone. This was just a technical reaction. This is what the market makers have to do. As I said, if you join our Patreon, you get a lot of information in my tutorials. But now the target price which I have here and this is just an algo squeeze is $2.94. That was the reason why I mentioned already here in the past that we have a squeeze potential of 500% and if we break $250 then we can talk about the short squeeze because the market makers the bears are waiting here in this price level. So if they get forced to close their positions if they cannot control the price anymore yes guys then we can talk about a short squeeze. And as you can see here in the chart, we have a lot of a lot of bullish price goals. $866 is also one of the possible possible price goals here for GoPro. And when we see where the stock came from and I zoom out for you guys. Yeah, I mean we we saw that already many many times here in the market that stock squeeze from $1 to $50. This is possible. $1 is a very significant price range. So when GoPro can find support above $1, we can see here anything possible if the volume is kicking in and especially when the market makers have or the short sellers have to close their positions, guys. So this is my game plan right now. Uh when we see the technicals here, of course, the RSI is now completely over bought. This is uh what I would not prefer to for more in. I'm waiting here for the next dip. I will trade GoPro again. And uh this is for me a quick in quick play. So take profits as long as we trading here in this trendal pattern. But if we start to leave this trendal pattern and find support here in this blue box guys. Yes. Then I will load up more shares here on GoPro and trade the next squeeze or even short squeeze for this stock. Yeah guys that was my quick and dirty update.
