AND AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS AND THIS IS IMPACTING THE CHARACTER OF WAR WE UNDERSTAND WE MUST TRANSFORM JUST AHEAD OF HER ADVERSARIES WE NEED TO GET BETTER BY 2026 AND 2027 NOT BY 2030. >> THE RACE FOR MILITARY GOT UNDER DOMINANCE IS NOT YEARS AWAY IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AS WE REMEMBER THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE U.S. MILITARY ON THE D-DAY WEEKEND. TOP ARMY GENERALS ON CAPITOL HILL MORNING AT THE U.S. DOES NOT ACCELERATE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND AUTONOMOUS TECHNOLOGY WE COULD FALL BEHIND ON THE BATTLEFIELD, JOIN AMINO U.S. ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF GENERAL RANDY GEORGE YOU TESTIFIED IN THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE HEARING THIS WEEK, HOW WORRIED ARE YOU HOW WORRIED SHOULD WE BE ABOUT THE U.S. POTENTIALLY FALLING BEHIND CHINA WHEN IT COMES TO A.I. AND TECHNOLOGY IN THE MILITARY. >> WERE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN AND I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT AMERICAN INGENUITY IS THE BEST IN THE WORLD AND MAKING SURE WORKING WITH THE COMPANY THROUGHOUT AMERICA TO REDUCE THE DRONES THAT WE NEED INSIDE OF HER FORMATION DRONES AUTONOMOUS SYSTEMS AND USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AND LOGISTICS IN TARGETING EVERYTHING THAT WERE DOING. AS YOU MENTIONED UPFRONT THINGS ARE RAPIDLY CHANGING AND WHAT IS NOT GOING TO CHANGE HIS GRIT AND DETERMINATION AND TOUGHNESS OF OUR SOLDIERS AND WE CONTINUE TO TRAIN AND TEST ON A DAILY BASIS AS WELL. MARIA: YOU HAVE INCREASING NUMBERS OF PEOPLE WANTING TO WORK ALONGSIDE YOU A BIG WIN FOR THE ARMY IN LISTING 61000 NEW TROOPS AHEAD OF THE SEPTEMBER DEADLINE, WHAT IS BEHIND THE SURGE IS IT ENOUGH TO FIX THE LONG-TERM RECRUITING CRISIS? >> WE WERE VERY HAPPY TO ANNOUNCE THAT AND ACTUALLY EVER BEST RECRUITING MONTH TYPICALLY WHEN THE FOLKS ARE GETTING OUT OF SCHOOL AND WE SEE A LARGER SURGE IN THE SUMMER VERY PLEASED THE NUMBERS AND FILLING OF THE FORMATION IS WHAT WE WANT TO DO WE HAVE GREAT RECRUITS OUT THERE AND WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO ENLISTING A WHOLE NEXT WEEK FOR THE 250th BIRTHDAY. MARIA: EXACTLY, NO PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SET TO HOST A MILITARY PARADE NEXT WEEKEND FOR 250th ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMY. IT HAPPENS UPON PRESIDENT TRUMP'S. HAS BEEN DONE SINCE 1991 GOOD BIT OF CRITICISM WE WERE POLITICIZING THE MILITARY FOR SOME REASON. I THINK TO CELEBRATE OUR ARMY IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE CAN DO, WHAT CAN YOU EXPECT FROM THIS PARADE NEXT WEEKEND. WORK CITED THIS AGAIN IS TRIGGER 50th BIRTHDAY IS A BIG DEAL WE'VE BEEN PLANNING THIS FOR A LONG TIME. EVERYBODY I BEEN IN THE ARMY FOR A LONG TIME PEOPLE LOVE TO SEE OUR EQUIPMENT MOST IMPORTANTLY THEY LOVE TALKING TO HER SOLDIERS AND WERE LOOKING FORWARD TO HAVING THEM HERE WE EXPECT SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE THIS AND HAVE IT ON THE NEWS AMERICAN SOLDIER AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WERE CELEBRATING. MARIA: GIVES PEOPLE THE PRIDE THAT WE NEED IN A VERY IMPORTANT TIME, HERE WE ARE FACING OFF AGAINST A TOUGH COMPETITOR IN CHINA. I KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE NAVY THE CHINESE HAVE A LARGER NAVY THAN WE DO AND WHAT CAN YOU TELL US ABOUT THE COMPETITION WITH CHINA AND WHAT YOU'RE EXPECTING ON THE BATTLEFIELD WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMMONEST PARTY IN HIS MILITARY. >> ONE OF THE BIG FOCUS AREAS IS IN THE PACIFIC WITH THE U.S. ARMY PACIFIC IN THE 25th INFANTRY DIVISION AGAIN WE KNOW THE BATTLEFIELD IS CHANGING AND WHAT WERE DOING TO CHANGE AND TRANSFORM OUR FORMATION THAT'S BEEN THE CENTERPIECE FOR US IS MAKING SURE WE ARE TRANSFORMING THE UNITS IN BRINGING THE LATEST TECHNOLOGY TO THEM AND MAKING SURE THAT WE STAY AHEAD. I'LL TELL YOU A LOT OF THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ARE GOING TO BE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE LOOK AT DRONES AND SOME OF THE SYSTEMS THAT ARE MUCH CHEAPER, THAT'S WERE FOCUSED ON AS WELL. THE BIG FOCUS IS MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE BEST AND REMAIN THE BEST ARMY IN THE WORLD YOU DO THAT WITH THE DOLLARS THAT WE'VE BEEN GIVEN.
