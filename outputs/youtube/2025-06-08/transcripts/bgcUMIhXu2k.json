  "transcript": "Felix and Winston here and Winston said to me that you might be worried what your favorite tech stocks are going to do this coming week. And if that's the case, you found the right video for you. I'm going to walk you through and you can see it on the screen here. Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Google, Meta, Tesla, Palanteer, PayPal, Alta, SoFi, HIMS, Archer, Regetti, uh a gold stock for good measure, a bit of NASDAQ, a bit of S&P, and then actually probably most importantly the VIX. I'll put timestamps in so you can jump around if you must. You know, Tik Tok brain and all of that, but you will miss kind of the thread of it. Uh my goal is also to always reinforce the learning process because there are little rules that we apply again and again and again. And I thought I'd also give you one more bonus today, which is another act of transparency as he takes office clothes. No, don't worry, that's not going to happen. Uh but what I want to actually show you is two things. one, I put out a list of stocks every week uh that I set up conditional buy orders on and I share them with my students. This was the week the the list from the week before last. And you just want to see how how that's done this week, right? 86%, 30, 30, 10%, 10% and so on. They're like 2, four, six, eight stocks that have gone up over 10%. What about the losers? Well, let's look at the losers. There are losers down here, but they're generally very small. And the worst one, LMA, we didn't actually end up buying because it never triggered our rules. So, this isn't rocket science. This is just following the good old tried and tested rules. So, how's it working for me? Well, let me share with you my month of May. And I'm not a huge fan of going I've done this, I've done that. But I think sometimes it's helpful perhaps to inspire a little bit. So, what can you see? Well, have a look at the daily performance of May. And you'll see a lot of red, right? a lot of red days and those are stops closing out misses at small losses. And then you get these big beautiful green ones and those are also stops taking profits on big gains where we moved our stops up. So you look at that and you think, okay, that wasn't so great, was it? No. $5,100 1.7% up. Leave the video now. Why are you watching this idiot? But you're missing something, which is that's the realized P&L, the realized profit and loss. the things we closed is $5,000. The unrealized P&L, which is where the actual money is, so trades we still have open, that's $40,000 on top. So, we actually did $45,000 on the month on this particular stock portfolio, uh, which is about 15%. Now, how do we ensure that we keep these unrealized gains stops? So, we have lots of these open here, like at 22%, 21%, 16%, 11%. We've got loads of those open. uh and then they are unrealized at present and if they drop a little bit and they hit our stop they become realized like these ones here which then close at some sort of gain. Just wanted to share with you a little bit how that works and how that looks. So we we aim for three outcomes three outcomes only. uh what are the outcomes that we permit? There is a bigly win, there is a small win, and then number three, there is a small loss. There is no fourth outcome. And that's actually what makes us money. This discipline, this automation, those rules. You want to learn those very rules, I'll give them to you completely for free, but you got to leave this video. You got to go to felixfriends.org/getfree /getfree and it'll actually get you free. It'll get you to financial freedom and you'll be as relaxed as that guy down there under the under the typewriter. So, let's kick us off then with with Microsoft and and hopefully you'll learn as we go through this. But really, you want to understand those rules first, which you get in that mini 15-minute master class that I put out for you for free. So, what have we got here? Well, we have a monstrous rising of um builds. I was going to say something else. Stock price. And um that is a a a a marvelous thing to happen. And and and how how did that get going? Well, I think the place to start would be that massive massive gap up on earnings, right? And that got us where? Well, that got us straight back into the sort of bulk of where the stock's been trading the last year or so. And after that, we came out of that. So, you could draw a couple more lines where we exceeded this high and then that high. And each time we did that, it was tremendous. And then you've got up here, and I'll actually draw a proper line for you that's actually straight to make this useful, the previous high. And the previous high was at about $468 on Friday. We closed significantly above that, right? And that is a big and beautiful thing, which is what Bills all the time. The resistance, which is where the market makers sell, by the way, is at 470. So only 61 cents above that. Slight um, you know, limping of uh of the stock price perhaps because of that. So, we might bounce off it again and do it, you know, try it a few more times. You know, eventually eventually we'll get there. But, um, yeah, it's um it's it's it's a big and powerful, you know, thrust up. So, yeah, looks very very bullish there on Microsoft. The only thing to watch out for is the resistance. Has that been moving? Yeah, it's keeps moving up and up and up. So, that's also pretty positive. So, um, brilliant setup. I would say moving average lines are pointing straight up in excitement. Now, let's move on from the um unpleasant thoughts about Bill uh and and his island adventures and instead move on to Nvidia. Nvidia, the shining beacon of the AI market and and and everything else that matters in the world is uh of course the representation of the AI trade, right? Is AI working? you know, uh, is what is it? Is our children learning? That's sort of the question you want to be asking yourself. And it looks pretty decent. So, what do I look for? Well, we look for a couple of things. 50-day moving average line that's moving up. We're above the 50-day moving average line that's moving up. And by the way, all this data, you can get that in in in Trade Vision. There's a link down below to that as well, including the Darkpool data and everything else. Maybe we'll have a look at that for Nvidia in a second. And then you want to look at like where is the recent resistance. So that was it, right? So we are we've closed above the closing price highs up here, which is good. We still have these two to kind of deal with which are a little bit higher, but this is a very very positive comeback from the comeback kit of 2025 and um yeah, $9 to the resistance. So I think we have a pretty pretty reasonable leg up to to 150 there. You can have a look on here on the right there's a little sort of um sniper thing and you can actually also on the top here there's a little thing you can toggle on and tells you what the buttons mean which can be quite useful I think uh for people and you can see every single day like what is the most bullish and bearish flow from institutionals um that's these are options trades which is what most institutions actually get up to and it gives you a little bit of an idea of maybe some things to look at shouldn't be the end of your your research and your conclusion but it gives you a a little bit of an idea. And if we click on trades, then up here, always make sure the date is the correct date. So the last one that you want to look at or whatever day you want to look at because it's the day days worth of data. So if I look at Friday 6th, Nvidia flow sentiment is bullish. Why is it bullish? Because institutions were buying $41 million of call options. That's very, very bullish. And you can see some there's also some puts. Some people are hedging which is also always a thing that happens. But yeah, some pretty good setups there. And one of the reasons and I did an Nvidia video for you guys. It was that options were super cheap on Friday on Nvidia and I think a lot of people took advantage of that which made a lot of sense. So therefore, you know, bullish traction going on over there. Now let's move on to the more my bund um the sort of walking dead of technology. Apple, you know, they're still when they release a new product, people still queue outside intents, but uh they are now often geriatrics and some of them pass away because of age. Uh so that's kind of what's happening to the Apple audience. I'm kidding. Of course, I'm just saying these guys have not come up with a new idea since the iPhone, right? Which is pretty shocking, isn't it? I think it's pretty shocking that lack of innovation. They didn't even buy any freaking innovation and they're still trying to figure out which way to go with the AI assistant. So, they're really not at the sort of forefront of stuff. And the stock chart is telling you what it's a falling knife. It's the um advanced money destroyer pattern like AMD. It is at this point saying to you, run Forest, run. Um and yeah, it doesn't look good. And and if you zoom in a little bit closer here, what do you see? Well, you see you see the yellow line there. That's the 50-day moving average line. Very important line that all of Wall Street watches and failed breakout here. Hit it there, bounced off it, hit it here, bounced off it, hit it here, bounced off it. Yesterday we basically closed at the line after hours a little higher. Uh but there is no enthusiasm from institutions. How do I know that? There is no volume spike. So, nobody's excited about Apple. Really, literally nobody. That doesn't mean it's a bad product. Doesn't mean they're not going to make money. Still, you know, second largest company in the world and all of that, but at the moment, it is experiencing one of those humph moments. And it's a it's a pretty significant hump over at Apple. At Amazon, things are looking a little bit brighter. Now, for a moment, they were thinking that if Spac X loses all its Trump contracts, then that would be good news because we would have to go and ask um Bezos, the Almighty, please, please, please fly us to space. To which Bezos would reply, we actually only fly close to space. We're not actually in space, but that's a different story. Um, so good setup. Yeah, actually that's actually a very nice setup. So, what would I look at here? Again, always draw a trend line, which is something connecting the highs. Closing highs I would usually use. So that line there is going to make it a different color. Uh we'll make it a bright bushy eyed green. And well, we closed significantly above that. Not only did we close significantly above that, we closed above it with what kind of candle? Put what kind of candle it is in the chat down below. One, two, three. That was your chance to do it. Uh it is a candle that looks distinctly like this. And what do we call this? We call this um Zeus's hammer. It is a hammer candle, which is a bullish thing. Why is it a bullish thing? Because it means at some point we were down here and then somebody came in and bought us all the way up to the top of that day's trading range. And that is a bullish move, which we like. The opposite of that is a that one there which looks like this which I call the um I dropped a hammer on my toe and it's bloody painful candle in which case we moved all the way up to there and then everybody sold and we moved to the bottom of that candle there. Are you starting to get that? Does that make some sense to you? Put a put a put a one in the chat and I know that that's sort of landing for you because this is kind of really important one-on-one chart reading stuff. And chart reading isn't like reading tea leaves by the way. It is a reflection of what everybody including every hedge fund, every investment bank, every fund out there is doing with their money with regards to the stock. So, Amazon closing very nicely here, way above the closing prices from early May. Uh, so this is bullish, very bullish. 50-day moving average lines moving up. The only thing is there's not a lot of volume. That's the only sort of sad story about it. But other than that, uh, Bzos will be quite happy about it and will undoubtedly offload a few more billions of stock. Uh, now Google, Google, Google Google, Google Google has done the classic ziggity zac recovery job here. And people often look at that and go, it's a buy. It's a buy. Look, it's going up. It's taken out the 50-day moving average. Let's jump all over it. And there might be some truth in that, but it's a risky endeavor. And this is a textbook case where it's a risky endeavor because there there there and there. What do we do? We managed to not close above the line that all lines are jealous of which is probably most important line in the world. It is the 150day moving average line. Now, why is it the most important line in the world? Because it decides whether or not you'll make money. And when we fail to break out of that like four or five times in a row, it's saying to us there is resistance, significant resistance. Now, we can also look up whether the market makers are to blame for that. They're not actually. They're a little lower. They're at 170. So, they might have a little bit to do with that, but not that much. So, I think we need to significantly break out above this line. So, I would be looking at sort of 175 176 maybe. Uh that would take us out of that zone and that would then open up the possibility that we might go back up to up here which is where when these guys the bag holders been keeping secrets under the mattress about the stock that they bought and that is now down but they're still boasting about all their Meta Planet adventures. Uh those guys will will will sell. So we'll you'll sort of get to about 180 190 and then around about there we'll probably going to go sideways again. That's at least the way I see it. Now, Meta Zuckerberg's little adventure. She's a beauty, isn't she? She's almost as good-looking as Zuckerberg himself. Um, what happened there with that guy? Complete transformation, right? He's now cool. He's like dancing and singing and he's he's cool. That's one of the things money will do to you, apparently. I'm still waiting for that, but um you you never know. This was our first gap up, right? So, that was a good thing. We also took out the 50 and the 150. The 50-day moving average line is curving up again. That's all pretty pretty nice. After the breakout, we got our second chance. Zig exact sideways a little bit. And then here on one simple day, we took out the previous resistance and we are going higher. We're going straight for the top. And that looks pretty good. Looks pretty good. Volume is so so that's the only thing. But yeah, looks pretty good. So better looking pretty bullish there from from where I'm sitting is of course not I'm not telling you to buy it. I'm just saying this is what how I see it. Tesla. Well, Elon's done a a a pretty special feat. He's pissed off every Democrat under the sun. Uh he's now pissed off very large chunk of Republicans apparently and um is uh is a yeah strange fellow really. Um I don't really get these emotional outbursts. I mean I just get a grip, right? you're the richest man in the world, like appreciate your uh you know, passionate about debt of your country, but um throwing the Epstein thing in there and all that stuff, that's just it just makes I think it makes him look a bit pathetic. I think Trump similarly, I think they both deserve to be uh put in the naughty corner for a for a few days uh and see if they can they can make up. But yeah, weird, isn't it? Richest man in the world, most powerful man in the world, and they have a hissy fit in the sandbox. But Tesla stock didn't like it. Yeah, we recovered 3.6% on Friday. Is that enough? Not really. It basically it gets us just about out of the real hot water here, which is that 50-day moving average line. So, we closed above that. That's good. Um volume is pretty decent on the recovery, but not as big as it was on the sell-off. So politics is like all the way into the Tesla stock now for some reason. Um my Tesla call options got closed out uh because I set stops. So there we are at the moment. I am naked on Tesla. I have no Tesla. I like the stock. I love the stock. I love what they're doing with um self-driving and technology and robots and everything else. But uh you got to you you can't ignore the momentum. You can't ignore the momentum. And at the moment the momentum is uh you know sort of a Chris Rocklike slap in the face. Now Palanteer probably shouldn't shout quite so loudly into the mic. Should I? Sorry about that if you were listening on on on headphones. That is a beauty. So our last buy was at 99 here. That was it. And we're up at 27% just from there. Uh there were many many many other buys before that. If you go back in time, the breakouts that the software here, but just trade vision puts onto the screen, the first one here starts at about $1245. So, you know, all thank you letters are welcome. Um, no, you don't need to thank me. You just have to like take responsibility for your own action, good and bad. And that's something always happens. People like, I did that. I I did the rally and then uh oh, the the one that I'm losing money on, that was that was his fault, right? I did that with Winston. like when it's Winston's fault when when a stock you know we don't we just don't have big losses so they're just we just don't have that conversation do we win Winston no we don't because we don't have big losses and therefore we don't really care about whether a stock collapses we just like okay can we make money out of it but that's the only thing so whereas this trading it's just going a little bit sideways and and that's again normal after a enormous rally like that we're in the middle of that sort of trading box we're in we basically need to take out the 135 to really continue this rally. Is that possible? Anything is possible with Palanteer. The market does not actually care about PE multiples or or some sort of fundamental nonsense um in the short term. Couldn't care less. So, the market can get as carried away as it likes. And if it wants this stock to go to 200, it'll go to 200. I'm not saying it will, but at the moment, we're at the very top end here. We just need to go up $8 and we're breaking out once more. PayPal on the other hand, well, well, well. Um, I'm seeing something that has me excited once again about PayPal. And that might be a little bit of a of a disease, a bit of an affliction because I've been excited about PayPal about two or three years now. But don't forget, we did actually make some some nice money on this, right? It it sort of broke out somewhere here and we did actually go up and we had a stop so we didn't do the idiotic thing of losing all the money again. And if you're doing that, I'm not calling you an idiot. I'm just saying you haven't been taught how to do it. So come and learn how to do it. Watch the master class, felix.org/getfree, and you will you will never have big losses again. It's a beautiful feeling. But what I want to show you here is um as Winston's moving around is this. Now, maybe it looks like a middle finger to you, in which case you are harboring some anger issues. Go and see your therapist. But what you actually want to do is recognize that this is an upside down head and shoulder. So, it's like doing a handstand, maybe not the best analogy, hanging upside down like a bat sort of thing. And what we then do is we find the armpits. Armpit one, armpit two. So, actually, just let me make this a little clearer for you. Shoulder, head, shoulder, right? Armpit, armpit. So, what do we do? We draw a line through the armpits. A nice smelly line. Hang on. Are we allowed to draw a line? Please, pretty please. Yes. So, something like that. No line is is scientifically accurate, by the way. It's just a line. And then what do we wait for? Well, we now wait for the glorious, the amazing breakout. If we break out above that line, you break out above that line and you typically, this is a fairly rare pattern, you typically get a monstrous rally. You don't have to, but you typically do. You still have the 150day moving average line to contend with that one there. But overall, we might be getting a monstrous rally. Now, does that mean I'm buying it before the monstrous rally? No, no, no, no, no, no. What I might do is set up a buy order that only triggers if we exceed a certain point on that line here. In which case, I will only buy it after it's popped its head over that line somewhat significantly. So, that's said the first time I've heard good news about PayPal in months. What about Alter Beauty? Is she still beautiful? Uh, so we bought this at $412 uh on the 13th of May, which was where somewhere somewhere around here because we drew that line there. And these lines are hopefully starting to become a little bit meaningful to you. That's also why I wanted to inspire you a little bit with like actually seeing what our returns are. So, that's at 13% or so in a space of about 3 weeks, which is which is pretty good. Now, there was a breakout after that, which was nice. And what happens after pretty much every single breakout in the history of man, and I consult your Roman history books. Well, usually we get a bit of this and then typically we get a bit of that, but nothing goes up in a straight line. So, a consolidation isn't really a problem. We just want to make sure that we don't drop significantly on big volume. At the moment, there is no volume, so we're still happy with Alta Beauty so far. So far is showing some signs of life which I was not expecting. So I've drawn in that that previous trend line here. I would actually now move that to connect these recent two highs. Um you can go for the closes which is the fat bit of the candle or for the top end. There's no real right or wrong answer on that one. Uh and you break out above that and and and you're kind of in business. The other way of looking at that would be draw a box. So draw a box basically and say I'm in the box. I want to break out of the box. Once you've broken out of the box, you know you're in business. So we're basically looking at just under $15 around about $15. We go to $15. Likely we're going to get a nice big beautiful bouncy breakout which would probably take us back to about 16 or 17 and then we'll probably fail and come back down. At least that's the way I'm seeing it. Why? because you got all these bag holders from up here who will all be selling uh when you go back up there because people people like to sell set sell set at zero which is a weird sort of human psychology now um them and theirs is flying still and doing a very good job of it and is this the moment to buy it? Um it's annoying to always say it's a little late, isn't it? But but it sort of is. It's a little late. It's a little extended I'd say. So if you really like this business and obviously to look a little bit into the business, then what you can do is it's a little warm over here today. What you can do is is is buy it on a pullback. Um but drop below that line sort of 60 uh 50 51ish or thereabouts. you would have a likely a bit more of a stronger pullback which might take you back to that 50-day moving average line. So, it really depends on your um your risk appetite. If you got in somewhere down here because you spotted the breakout, then I would set a stop slightly lower than that. If you are looking to get into it, I would personally wait for it to go a little bit lower. Obviously, not financial advice, just telling you what I see and how I see it and what I I might do. Now, Archer, Archer, Archer. Uh, we are still in Archer, thankfully, cuz I set a very generous stop-loss. Why did I set a very generous stop-loss? Because this is a bonkers stock that moves, I mean, tremendously. Look at these, look at these moves in a day, like 40% in a day. So, if you set a 5% stop loss and you buy something like this, you'll get knocked out before you've said, \"I bought this stock.\" And you're like, \"Oh, no, I didn't.\" And all you're doing is just handing money over to your broker. So, uh, what are we doing here? Right? So that trend down here, which was, let me get a pen. That was sort of our downtrend, right? Classic ziggity zaggedy downtrend. We broke out of that here. That was very good. And then somewhere here was our entry point. We bounced off and then we've almost traced or pretty much traced all the way back to the beginning of that breakout here. And that can often happen, especially with high-risk stocks like this one. And then on Friday, we got a nice big juicy green candle, 8.8% up. After hours, those with strong hangovers and drug addictions realized it and bought the stock up. After hours, another 8% taking us to 15 60% on the day. And that takes us back into sort of the previous peaks level here, which is that blue box that I put in. So that looks very, very bullish. Does that mean it's too late to buy it? Not necessarily. It's a second chance breakout. So, I'm liking it. I'm glad we're still in it. Up to you what you do with that information. Obviously, rieti our sadly not Italian. It says trading. That's the I guess there's no quantum computing section yet sector yet. There should be. So it did something bad which should put it into the naughty corner and that is it fell below our upward trend here right quite significantly. Not a lot of selling because the volume was pretty low. We're still above the 50 and the 150day moving average line. So still going sideways. So again, I'm not too worried about this because we're above these two lines and it is quantum computing. We're just one of the more bonkers sectors to be in. What about gold? The good shiny stuff. We love gold, don't we? We just love gold. It's so shiny, didn't you? But when I was little, I was reading um those Disney comics. There were those little books that were quite thick and there was always Scrooge McDuck in it swimming around in his little little safe house. That's always what I wanted to be honest with you, which is perhaps why I pursued a career in banking. Uh, we're now up 25% from the last entry point, which is pretty decent. So, what are we doing with it? Not a lot to be honest with you. Maybe move the stop up a little bit. That might be a reasonable thing to do. And you have to kind of learn the art of that. Maybe somewhere here. Something like that. Again, that's not an advice. I'm just saying where I would some probably put it. And and and it looks good. Yeah. Liking it a lot really. So, we continue to be in gold. We've actually seen a lot of gold stocks grow just one example of that. And especially on days where the market's a bit iffy, we just make money with that. It's a really, really nice feeling. And what about tech? Well, well, well, well. It's almost as if the whole Trump tariff thing never happened. And you know what? My present interpretation of the politics for which I, by the way, get get uh no matter which way I say see it. People always say, \"Oh, you love Biden, you love Trump, or you hate him, or you hate him.\" I I don't really care all that much. I'm just in it for the money. That's literally it. It's a It's a completely cynical, selfserving approach to politics. Um I don't vote anywhere. Actually, I can't really. I'm German born. I mean, you leave Germany after seven years. They take away your right to vote, which is uh perhaps a good thing. It means you stop bothering with it and you just give up on the country. Uh so yeah, I don't vote anywhere. And and and um it's a it's a nice feeling really. But if you just look at if you just look at where we are trading right now and we drew a little box across. Can we extend that box? Please tell me we can extend that box. Yay, we can. So where are we? We're are basically back in the very tops of this market of the all-time highs. So expect a little bit of choppiness up there. As I say, nothing goes up in a straight line. the market makers sit at 540 which is again trade vision data here which is the very very very top of the where we've been. So we're at 530 right now. So 10 points up and then we'll probably hit our head uh and and bounce back a little bit sideways. So looks very good. Looks very good. The spy uh similar setup just a little lower. Resistance is a little lower as well. So we're sitting at 600 with the resistance. We're trading at 59914. And look at Friday. See how we broke through that but we didn't close above it. Let me show you Friday. So I'm going onto a five minute chart here to show you what happens every time we hit you see the red the red line right that's the resistance that's where the market makers sell. So here basically they were selling here they should have been selling and at the beginning of the day they should have been selling. And what do you see when we break out above it? Well, the market makers get the clobbering hammer out and they clobber us, right? So, volume spikes up. Uh, similarly here, we broke out, volume spikes up. That's institutional money and the beginning of the day. Uh, anyway, there is that very significant volume there. So, you can basically see them live selling. Now, they're not selling it because they hate you or they have a conspiracy against you or they know where your particular stop or trade is. They just sell because it's hedging flows. How do I know that? We've got three or four market makers on our team. Retired ones, the nice ones. Um, that's also where we understand the data. So, check that out. And then, uh, last, but certainly most importantly, we have the Vicks. And this is what makes me want to sing and dance with Winston. Um, where is Winston? Oh, he's he's down here. Um, can you still see him? No, you can't. He's moved down here. We're at 1677. That means we are in low fear. If I go back onto a day chart for you and I wrote on here below 20, we're okay. We're at 1670. We're below the um 26th of March lows. We're back to basically pre make America tariff everything again day. And and and that's a beautiful thing and that sets us up for a very very beautiful start to the week. So unless somebody decides to something up, all the indicators are showing we should have a great week ahead. And I look forward to making lots of money. And I hope you do the same. And really the only way to do that is not to find the one random stock. I hope I give you one tip or FOMO buy into the latest thing you're getting on some sort of subscription, but actually to learn what makes a great stock as in in that moment. When do we buy it?

I'm going to move my stops up a little bit to make sure we lock those in. But that's really really the end of it. So go and learn that. Felix/getfree is where you get access to that 15inute lesson which teaches you the rules. And I wish you a tremendous week. All the best. You have done that.

Because I buy depending on what the market's telling me. I don't develop conviction. It's a disease I'm immunized against. So I want to walk you through here the setup for Nvidia which includes a better way to buy Nvidia and lower risk higher return and also is it time yet to change our mind on AMD the advanced money destroyer the thing I've been maligning for about a year now and well wait for it in a",
