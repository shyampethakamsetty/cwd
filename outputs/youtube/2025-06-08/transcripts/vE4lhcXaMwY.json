  "transcript": "all right guys we're looking at djt as you can see here on the one-year chart we went from $11 all the way up to 57 that was a 399 gain it's pulled back since then from $58 all the way down to about 29 that's a 50% pullback what you need to do is just watch these levels we need to see is this a higher low or not as you can see in this consolidation area is it holding this spot here if it's not going to we are going to see more um downtrend down here so let me just show you really quick going on the 3mon here you can zoom in at this location and around $23 would be your next setup and then I'd be potentially watching just the whole dollar at $20 a share so I just want to show you real quick right here with this horizontal line watch out for the $20 Mark and be patient this stock has been pulling back since $57 a share and it has more downside to come I mean you have the inauguration for Trump coming a few months from now just be cautious we might get a pull back maybe to $20 maybe even lower and then maybe a pop from there any news with Trump that's negative is going to pull this stock back and most likely any positive Catalyst will make it move forward so definitely keep an eye on it",
