  "transcript": "Hey traders, welcome back to this week's weekly forex forecast. Last week was another fairly slow week, you know, coming out of May, looking for opportunities to start picking up once again, you know, in an abundant way in forex because May was quite a slow month as we spoke about in previous videos. But last week with non-farm payrolls on the Friday, you know, non-farm payrolls week can be slow as well. So it looks like first Friday of the month, non-farm payrolls, you know, of course, which was yesterday, still kind of capped volatility in forex. So hopefully now with non-farm payrolls out the way, we should start to see, you know, an abundance of opportunities coming back into the markets, but US dollar weakness still persists and going into this week, US dollar weakness as a theme and also US dollar short setups are right at the top of my list. Okay, so kicking off with Euro dollar because when we go through the portfolio selection process in a minute as we do every single week, you'll see the euro is my number one long theme heading into next week mean I want to be long the euro wherever I can and the US dollar is my number one short theme. So I am interested in Euro dollar is right at the top of my watch list next week for bullish opportunities. I would like to see Euro dollar coming down breaching the 1.1273. This is where we enter the buy zone between these two levels and this is where we turn oversold during the week. So intra week and as soon as we trade into the buy zone I'm going to be looking for a couple of things. First of all I'm going to look to see if it forms its own support. So it comes down kind of bounces test the lows and we start to see momentum fading. If I get this setup and this is the exact setup that I'm looking at every single day with GMT members. We don't pull the trigger every single day but I am looking for this opportunity every single day. And then you know other days we might pull the trigger two three times. So I will be looking for this setup next week. I want to start to see it double bottoming in this area. If it fails to do that, if it just comes down and goes straight through like this, it sells off, maybe a small pullback, and then it goes through the prior low into this low. This would be a bit of a line in the sand where I'll be looking for a long opportunity. So, let's go through the stages here. I'm going to look for this to come down. First and foremost, trade below the 1.12735. That's because we then enter the buy zone. We're oversold during the week. So the odds of a reversal whether we trade into a prior low or not go up, right? Then we're stacking more odds on this by looking for prior support. So a place in the past primarily where price was tested and driven higher. So that kind of confluence of being oversold and trading into a support level. So when we come down here, I'm going to be looking for this. But if it goes straight through and tests this, this is where I'm going to be looking for momentum to fade. So either way, I'm going to be looking for momentum to fade. Whether it starts to fade before taking this out or whether it trades straight into it, I'm going to be looking for that one or two day reversal back inside the range because that's my objective each week is to try and capture with any of these setups one to two days worth of volatility out of, you know,5. So that's what I'm going to be primarily looking for. If we come all the way down and I might buy it here and then it sells off down below the 1.11513. We've got this gap close and of course this low here would be the second place I would consider potentially timing a long opportunity. If I'm not already long then you know this would definitely be somewhere I'd be considering. The only thing is as many of you know but maybe new viewers don't know is that you know we rarely test these gold levels. So it's unexpected to come down here, but if we do below the 1.11513 is where we become extremely oversold during the week. It's the second place I can pull the trigger on long position. And the third thing is you can look for that inte breakout. Just bear in mind one thing. We trade back down below towards the lower bound and then you get the rebreak with momentum. Moving average follows it, hugs it and then you get that bull flag set up into the profit taking zone above the 1.15179. Just bear in mind next week we do have CPI on Wednesday. So primarily I'm going to be looking for this setup kind of Monday into Wednesday. And if it doesn't come before then I will wait until CPI comes out. Then I'll start to look at the US dollar pairs once again. Okay. So moving on to the portfolio selection. You can see that the euro is the number one long theme to the upside and the dollar is still the number one short theme to the downside. Interestingly, with both the euro and the US dollar at 100%. This is showing a pretty maxed out performance. And although it can stay at 100%, you know, for a little while, this tends to preede bigger reversals. So, until that happens, you know, something we don't want to kind of preempt because if it doesn't happen for a few weeks and you know, you're kind of on the wrong side of things for a few weeks. But, it is something just to be wary of. So, you know, you're getting involved in these things and they start to look like they're picking up steam in the other other direction. You can just kind of reference back and say, \"Okay, maybe we're seeing a bigger reversal now.\" Does that make sense? So, that's really just how I'm using that. More of an observation than anything that is going to change, you know, the process or anything that we go through normally. But euro longs are definitely at the top of my watch list for bullish reversal setups next week. Alongside that, I am looking to the downside in the Japanese yen. So, I want to be short the Japanese yen. Then you sort of have a pick. You know, it's not going to be the New Zealand dollar, but you know, Aussie is kind of bearish, but getting stronger. The pound is actually neutral and getting weaker. CAD is neutral and getting weaker. So there there is an argument to say you could, you know, you could look for pound frank to the downside. Certainly euro pound to the upside. You could look at euro CAD to the upside. You could look at pound uh CAD frank to the downside. So, you know, one and two either side are pretty straightforwards. Uh Swiss Frank being the number two long theme that I'm interested next week and then after that you can kind of you can kind of pick and choose a little bit. For me, as it currently stands, I will still be looking at Aussie shorts as number three. And to the long side, I'm going to go with New Zealand dollar. So, primarily what I'm going to be looking for next week. In terms of the pairs that I'm interested in that are top of my watch list, it is Euro Dollar, which we've already looked at to the upside. So, I'm only interested in buying opportunities in Euro Dollar. I cannot sell Euro Dollar next week. I'm also interested in Euro Yen to the upside. Going to look at Euro Aussie to the upside in today's video. US dollar Swiss Frank to the downside. US dollar uh New Zealand dollar actually to the downside. Sorry, to the upside. So, quick recap. Eurussie to the upside. Going to be looking at US dollar frank to the downside. Frank yen to the upside and Aussie Frank to the downside. And we're also going to be looking in today's video at New Zealand dollar to the upside, New Zealand yen to the upside, and Aussie New Zealand to the downside. Okay, so kicking off the watch list as we do with crude oil. Crude oil is still a short and I thought actually this was going to be something I was going to be able to trade last week because it came right up to its weekly upper bound and it just sat there. The weekly upper bound was somewhere here and it kind of sold off, pushed up, sold off, pushed up, sold off. I thought right here this is where it was going to trigger and I was going to start to look for a short above these highs. However, nothing really happened and then it looks like it triggered right at the death, you know, in the final kind of 4 hours or so. So, there was no opportunity there for me last week, but I am still interested in shorts. And what's interesting about this is for those of you who watch previous videos, you'll know this is the underside of a major descending triangle pattern where the target is about $45 in the bigger picture. So any push higher this week into the underside of the big descending triangle is also likely going to push this into the sell zone which is above the 68.47. Now for me I'm only primarily looking for these once they enter buy or sell zones. That's the trigger. I get an alert in Hedge Dash and essentially I start to look then, you know, I don't sit there staring at charts all day looking for setups because if you look for setups, you will find them and they will almost certainly be substandard because if you're going out and you're not having a process which basically tells you when to trade, you end up telling the market when to trade. It's the same for everybody. Even me, if I were to sit there all day staring at setups, I would also find setups because that's what you're trying to do. You're trying to find setups, right? And that that actually is one of the things that causes overtrading. So you really want to have some kind of process, whatever that is, that tells you, yes, now is the time to start to look for opportunities. And when there isn't high probability setups, it just keeps you out of the market, right? And that's what the buy and sell zones are very, very good at. So if the market's not moving, nothing triggers, right? That pair is just a nothing for that week. You know, we look elsewhere. But if we can trade above the 68.47, 47. This is where I'm going to begin to look very carefully in crude oil because as it currently stands, we have this kind of big bare flag after this selloff and the breakout of the major pattern. So any kind of pullback would be a test of the underside. I will be looking above this level for a one or two day reversal. And again, this is such a big pattern that you know, this is probably just going to be the wick. you know, on a weekly candle, this could very easily come up, do this, and essentially that would just look like this on the weekly chart. You know, an underside test of the descending triangle pattern. So, that's what I'm going to be looking for in crude oil. I can only be short next week in this market or do nothing. If we blast all the way through, although it's unexpected, the 72.18 is where we become extremely overbought during the week. And if it does do that, although it's unexpected, that would be the second place I could pull the trigger on a short, whether I'm short ready or not. And the third thing is, you know, in commodities, breakout trading works actually better than in forex because they're much more volatile. You can look for that break down below the moving average. Moving average follows it and you get that kind of bare flag selloff. Here's one I looked at previously. You know, I've shown in previous videos. It attempts one down here, attempts down here, and then fails. But you can look for that bare market pullback and that selloff down to the 61.06. That would be the profit taking target for any intraweight shorts in crude oil next week. But I cannot buy crude oil still. I can only sell this market. Continuing on then with the euro pairs. Next is Euroyen. I can only be a buyer of this market. I cannot sell Euroyen. So I want to see is I personally want to see Euroyen pullback and trade below the 16330 because that's where it will enter the buy zone. That's where I'll get triggered an alert a notification to say look at Euroyen. Right? Because we're in the buy zone. You need to look. So I'll come over to Euroyen and I'll start to look. And ideally, what I'd like to see is these lows taken out. I mean, there's multiple lows here. Notice the gap close over here, by the way. There's multiple lows here because we don't have that yet in Euro dollar. There's multiple lows down here. And this is a pretty well supported area by the looks of it. So, multiple times in the past when price traded down to this level, you know, I don't know roughly what the 163, then it got pushed higher. So, if it can come all the way back down and retest this level in the buy zone next week, this is going to be what I consider a high probability opportunity. I'm going to be looking for bullish reversal patterns and a liquidation back inside the range. Back inside the range, back inside the range for one or two days. If we end up all the way down below the 16156, though, if we breach the bigger range outside of that, we become extremely oversold during the week. And it is the second place I can pull the trigger on a long position if I so wish. We also have a nice low. So, anytime we kind of breach these levels, I'm looking left. And right down here, this would be the second place I'd be looking to potentially time a long opportunity. Again, you know, I don't expect it to come down here. Unless you have a significant catalyst, it's unlikely to do that because if it does do that, this signifies a major reversal. So, it's unlikely to do that. This market, you know, is a buy or do nothing for me. The third and final thing is, of course, the inte breakout. So, we've already started to get momentum. You can see, look, we kind of had a consolidation here. So, it may not come all the way down. You know, if it doesn't come all the way down, then I probably won't be able to trade this. However, if we start to make our way down close to this and then you get that sharp reversal and again, you get new momentum to the upside. You should, you know, maybe expect one of these during the week in the 4 hours. More than that is unlikely because, you know, one big rally up with momentum, then the consolidation and then the move into the upper bound. That's the kind of bull flag setup continuation pattern you can look for, you know, if you like to trade Fibonacci etc. And third Euro pair is Euro Aussie. I can only be a buyer of this market or do nothing. I cannot sell this market. So I want to see this market coming down breaching the 1.73405 and trading into this low. Ideally, you know, if we breach this and we enter the buy zone, now we're oversold during the week in a market I'm looking to be long. And if we trade into a prior significant low, which pushed price higher, this increases the odds of a reversal. And what's actually happening is, you know, we're getting sellers selling into this and as it starts to struggle, they book profits. New traders step in for the reversal and that adds to the liquidation back inside the range. And usually, you know, looking to capture one to two days. If we end up below the 1.7134, I don't expect this to happen, but it is the second place I can pull the trigger on a long. And the third and final thing is, you know, a kind of dynamic trend line almost the moving average here whereby if you're coming down, you know, and it rebreaks and you want momentum. You don't kind of want to see it chopping around. You want to see a clear break higher. You can look for the bull flag setup into the profit taking zone above the 1.7753. But I can only be a buyer of this market next week. Okay. So, moving on to the dollar pairs. I can only be short US dollar Swiss Frank or do nothing. Buying this market is not an option for me. Just remember, as I said earlier, we have US CPR on Wednesday. So, I'm going to be looking for these opportunities in the US dollar pairs and the euro pairs, probably all forex pairs to be honest with you, but certainly the US dollar and euro pairs from Monday into Wednesday. Ideally, you know, the earlier on in the week the better because, you know, say you catch something late Tuesday and it doesn't go anywhere, then you're holding through CPI, which is fine if you want to take the risk. It's just, you know, bigger risk, bigger reward type of thing when you hold through news events. But I would rather just be out of the news event, out of the catalyst because I'm trading these markets, you know, in the opposite direction to initial momentum. So what I'd like to see is I'd like to see this push higher. If it doesn't do this, you know, by Wednesday, I'll wait for CPI to come out and then look for a potential trade afterwards. But I'd like to see US dollar frank trading above the 0.83204. And if you look left, it's pretty conspicuous right here. I mean, this is a really nice potential setup right at the prior high here. This is where I'll be looking for buyers to attempt to break out to get trapped and then that liquidation back inside the range is what I'll be looking to profit from next week. If we end up above the 0.84253, which is possible after CPI, you know, highly, highly, highly unlikely that's going to happen before CPI unless there's some other catalyst, but it could happen after CPI. CPI can bring directional moves into the dollar pairs. So, you know, the second up and lower bounds in the dollar pairs could very well be tested next week after CPI. If you know, nothing happens, we get CPI and this blasts all the way through and maybe I filter out that first short, the 0.84250 is the second place and there's a nice high here as well to time that on is the second place I can look to pull the trig on a short. Even if we get a bullish reaction after CPI, you know, CPI comes in slightly hot and expecting the dollar goes up, I can still only short this market or do nothing. I don't have to short it. I could just leave it. You know, if it looks a bit too risky of a short, you know, the market's ripping and it's a really strong print, you know, then maybe I could just sidestep it. But I certainly cannot buy it next week. The third and final thing and with CPI, you know, I'd probably be if I was trading this kind of intrae breakout, if you're trading Fibonacci, I would only really look for this after the news event because before the news event, the markets chop around. So, very good for me reversion and after the news event becomes more directional. You tend to see, you know, breakout trading can outperform. So, after CPI, you know, you get a weaker dollar and it sells off straight away. You can look for that bare flag setup post CPI into the profit taking zone at 0.81108. Next is Frank Yen. I can only buy this market next week. I cannot sell it. And if you look at this, it looks like we're starting to get the next big leg up after this major consolidation. So, what I'd like to see is ideally I'd like to see this come down, not break out higher to the upside and start to take out these lows here. Why? Because these lows are sitting in the buy zone at the 174.42. 42 and they are prior support levels which have driven price higher. So not only do we have the chances of bouncing increase just by entering the buy zone but trading into prior lows and you know starting to fail. This is where we're looking for those high probability setups. I'm going to be looking for one or two day liquidation back inside the range if that takes place. If we end up below the 17265 again not expecting this to happen. There's a couple of nice lows over here. one and two, but it's just a backup plan. It's just a plan B. That is the second place I can pull the trigger on long opportunity as many of you will know. And the third and final thing is because we're already starting to break out, you may find this doesn't pull back, you know, down to the 174 next week. It may be the case that it just chops around and then you get the CPI data, you get the next rally up. That's what breaks out this kind of consolidation pattern, that catalyst. You can look for that pullback after CPI and the bull flag setup into the profit taking zone next week at the 177.94. And third pair we're going to look at here is Aussie Frank. Now again, you could probably trade CAD Frank to the downside, pound Frank to the downside also next week, but Aussie CAD is third on my list. So what I'd like to see is I'd like to see some strength come into Aussie CAD. Why? Because I'm looking to short it. So I want to see this market turn overbought during the week. And again, it's not really trading a reversal because the primary trend here is to the downside. So essentially, although it looks like a reversal because, you know, it pushes up during the week and then I short it, it looks like I'm, you know, trying to pick tops. But actually, we're doing that in the context of a secondary trend or a bigger correction. Whereas every time it pushes up, looking short it, every time pushes up, looking short it, looking short it, looking short it, etc. So if we can breach the 0.5405, we turn oversold during the week and this high would be great. There is kind of a mini one down here, but this high would be perfect. An attempt to break out, you know, above the prior kind of consolidation high, which is here, that would be a great place to start to look for a failure and a one or two day liquidation back inside the range. If we end up all the way above the 0.5480, that's the place we become extremely overbought during the week. And it's the second place I can pull the trigger on a short. Although I don't expect it to get there. You shouldn't expect it to get to these levels. It can do, especially with, you know, a catalyst like CPI, but you generally speaking shouldn't expect that. It's just kind of a backup. And you may also get, you know, a fast market to the downside where it attempts to take out the upper bound and instead it ends up breaking down. You know, again, we're using the moving average here just as a kind of dynamic trend line throughout the week. And then you can look for that bare flag setup into the profit taking zone at 0.52547. Whatever happens next week, I cannot buy this market. I can only short Aussie Frank next week. Okay, so wrapping up the Forex universe with the New Zealand dollar pairs before we move on to gold and silver. Starting with New Zealand US dollar. I can only be long this market next week. So what I want to see is I want to see the market coming down breaching the 0.59365. We turn oversold during the week and we have two really nice prior lows right here. So market came down, tested this level and rallied. Tested this level and rallied twice before. So this is the exact area I'm going to be looking to time a potential reversal as sellers pull their positions if it struggles at this low here. I'm looking for that liquidation back inside the range for one or two days. If we end up below the 0.5858, there's another really nice low down here to time any long trade on. But that is the second place I can pull the trigger on long position if I so wish. And the third and final thing, of course, perhaps after CPI on Wednesday is you get a rally, strong rally. Maybe we get very weak CPI data. Moving average follows it and that sets up your bull flag setup if you like to trade Fibonacci into the profit taking zone which is above the 0.6092 6092 next week. Next is New Zealand yen. I can either be long or do nothing in this market next week. I cannot short it. So the lower bound sits at the 8583. So this is where I want to see this market coming down to. If it does enters the buy zone, I'll get an alert to say look at this market and I will immediately look left. Here's a low. So a prior place where market came down, tested this price point and reversed. Tested this price point and reversed. Tested this price point and reversed. somewhere down here. Doesn't really matter exactly where, but certainly below this low is where I'll start to look. That's where I'm going to be looking to time potential reversal to the upside for one or two days back inside the range. If we end up below the 8455, this is the second place. And there's a nice low right here. I can look for potential bullish setups for that one or two day reversal back inside the bigger range. That's where we become extremely oversold during the week. And the third thing is of course and with the yen pairs you know if you're trading breakout trades yen pairs are pretty good for breakout trading in forex relative to other pairs because they are quite volatile. So you can get some very nice directional moves in the yen pairs you know slightly more than other pairs relatively speaking. But if you get that rebreak back above the moving average with momentum, so pulls back, kind of consolidates, and then you get the trend breakout, you can for those who like to trade those kind of bull flags and Fibonacci setups, look for that into the 88.38, which is the profit taking target next week in New Zealand yen. And last but not least, we have Aussie New Zealand. I can only short this market next week. I cannot be a buyer of this market. So what I will be looking for is I'll be looking for Aussie New Zealand to show some strength because then I'm looking at it and saying this is not what's expected. Therefore, I'm going to treat this as a mispricing. You know, essentially a mistake and I want to see the traders taking this above the 1.08573 next week in this pair and pushing it into these highs here. This would be perfect. Now, we do have a high here, so you have to be a little bit careful. or it might just wick it, you know, and fail at this high and then sell off. But if we blast through this high and we enter the sell zone quite deeply, this would be a perfect place. You know, the further into the sell zone, the better, right? You know, if we get too far, you know, especially up until about halfway, we get too far, you know, you could probably expect the second bound to be taken out, but certainly, you know, deeper tests are better because the more we push into this, the more kind of extended we are on the week. So, that's going to be the prior high that I'm going to be looking to time potential reversals from because buyers start booking their profits and new shorts step in for that one or two day liquidation. If we end up above the major high and the 1.09249, this is the second place I could look for a potential short in this market. And the third and final thing of course is if you get the intrae breakout starts to move back, but then we just see real weakness. The moving average follows it and this kind of would look something like this, right? Pushes up, pushes down, pushes up, pushes down and then it fails and you get the breakout, you know, kind of trend line breakout, pulls back, bare flag setup into the prior low, which sits right at the profit taking zone at the 1.07221. So, I can only be a seller of Aussie New Zealand next week. I cannot buy this market. Okay, so wrapping up the video with gold and silver. The message last week was I can only be a buyer in these markets. I cannot sell gold. I cannot sell silver. Why? Because I have a bearish bias in the dollar. Although the dollar does look like it's a bit overdone to the downside some point. Probably going to get a bit of a near-term bottom. But when we have a weaker dollar, especially a very weak dollar, this can cause or at least clear the way for bigger moves up in gold and silver. So, I still only want to be a buyer of gold and silver next week given the opportunity. Last week in gold, we actually had a rally up, pull back, and a secondary rally. Bit of a bull flag setup there. Breaks above the moving average and then rallies into the high. And we also traded into the weekly upperbound and sold off last week. In fact, did that I think a couple of times. I think we did it here and over here. So, going into this week, what I'd like to see is I'd like to see gold come down, take out the lower bound at the 3236.29. This is where we enter the buy zone. There's a nice low here. And this is where I'm going to begin to look for double bottoms, inverse head and shoulders. I'm going to be looking for a one or two day reversal back inside the range. If we end up below the 3157.08, we are then extremely oversold on the week and this would be signifying a much bigger reversal lower most likely. It's unlikely to happen, but if it does, you know, we've probably seen the dollar bottom. I'm not saying that's going to happen next week, but you know that would be indicative of that. There'd have to be some big catalyst for that to happen. However, it is the second place I can, if I so wish, start to look for a long setup if I want to. And the third and final thing, of course, pretty much like we looked at here last week, it breaks above the moving average, consolidates, you get a secondary rally. This doesn't actually go very far. You get a secondary rally. You can look for that again. You know, if we break back above the moving average, moving average follows it. consolidation rally into the upper bound in this case at 3394.70. That's where the profit taking target sits for any intraweight longs in gold next week. And last but not least, we have silver. Silver ripped higher into its weekly upper bound. It stopped. We saw profit taking coming in from the weekly upper bound. It consolidated at the weekly upper bound, which I think was somewhere around here. And then we got the rally up to the second upper bound last week. That's why we have portfolio selection because this was something that you really wanted to either be a buyer or doing nothing in last week. You didn't want to be a seller of this market. So once again coming into this week, we had a really nice rally up. I'd like to see this do the opposite. Come down, take out the lower bound first, breaching the 3423. This is where I'd be looking to buy the dip. There's a nice low over here created last week and that's a good place to start to see sellers getting trapped and looking for that one or day liquidation back inside the range. If we end up below the 3251, we would be extremely oversold and this would be where I could also look for a long opportunity. Again, you know, after that rally up, second upper bound last week, second lower bound this week. Very, very unlikely. Something extreme would have to happen. It's very unlikely it's going to do that. So, I don't expect that to happen at all. But as a backup, the 3251 is where we turn extremely oversold, just for reference. And the third and final thing very much like you know bit like last week we break above the moving average we consolidate into it. Don't have to touch it just kind of hug it and then you get the secondary rally. You can very easily see that again this week comes down doesn't take out the lower band. Instead you get the rebreak consolidation and then the secondary rally again. Notice push up consolidation second rally in gold. Push up consolidation second rally but kind of fails at the high. That's the kind of bull flag setup, that kind of continuation setup where I say you probably will just get one, you know, in any given week. And of course, you know, the stronger the market, the further it should go. So, I can only be a buyer of silver next week. I cannot sell silver under any circumstances.
