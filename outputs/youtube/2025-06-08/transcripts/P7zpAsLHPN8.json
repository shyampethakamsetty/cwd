  "transcript": "What's going on everybody? It's Friday, June 6. We're doing a weekly recap here on the stock market. Things look a little ugly right here. I'm going to explain exactly what it is that I see taking place from an intermarket standpoint. So, you're going to get a little deep dive into that, but also there when you look peel behind the curtains, there's a lot of beauty going on, too. So, we're going to talk about some of the trade setups, trade ideas that I think may play out well within this market environment, give you some uh that that are based off of good risk-to-reward. So, we're going to hop right into it today. Starting with what I think is kind of ugly, and that is looking up here at the 11 sectors that make up the S&P 500. We have energy leading the way up 1.88%. Now, if you look across the board, markets were up, things are all good. VIX was way down. Look at we we have we had important macro data come out. The market loved it, right? It it kind of wa, you know, wiped aside all that craziness that was going on with Elon Musk and Trump, and we saw the markets recover quite fast. I'm not too shocked, right? We talked about on the last video how it just feels like it could blow over. But remember in other videos we talked about when energy is the stronger performing sector and that's something to really pay attention to. Now why is that? Well typically energy and the 10-year yield move up hand in hand. You can see the 10-year yield was up today 2.64 64. And in the last few videos, we've been talking about how the we've been kind of consolidating here, tightening up, and we've been seeing these higher lows where this can potentially be something that plays off. And we looked at the oil chart, too. Now, remember, energy and the 10-year yield. Go figure, right? They move handinhand to one another. You can see energy and green moving handinhand with the black line 10-year yield. And you can take a look at oil, right? We were talking about oil down here. here. So, if you want to watch those videos when we were talking about it, I believe it was down here around here and we broke out and pressed higher and we were saying basically, hey, wouldn't be surprised if we came back up to around 66 to around 68. We kind of drew out a box kind of in around this area. Hey, potentially even higher. But the reason why I say watch oil is because oil has been a good leading indicator as where 10-year yields potentially go. So, when we saw oil consolidating and if we're saying, hey, if this breaks out, there's a likelihood that we might see the 10-year yield start to rise too. Watch those correlations. And then also energy may be somewhat of a trade idea setting up. Now, the reason why I say once again why this can be ugly is if oil continues to climb here, one, it's inflationary, but two, knowing that energy stocks, you know, are correlated strongly with the move in oil, that's where this chart comes back into play, right? energy relative to the S&P 500. When this line goes up, what is the S&P 500 doing beneath us? As you can see, yeah, we outperform the S&P 500 today. Energy did, but it hardly even moved, right? So, you could have both the S&P 500 up and energy up and this stay relatively muted. But just know that when energy outperforms it from a wider standpoint, when it really starts to gain relative performance on the S&P 500, that's when we seeing the changes in the S&P 500 get a little bit more bearish. And this couldn't come at a more particular time because if you do look at the S&P 500, we are contracting here rather tightly with these negative divergences. You have a rising wedge structure. I know rising wedges are typically bearish, but I just like to see how things expand and then eventually contract. We can still very well break up to the upside, but it's going to be uh critical to watch where some key levels are. You have the NASDAQ 100, too. Look how tight this thing is getting. We talked about the reversal candle yesterday where we gapped up outside bar like this. That's typically a two- bar reversal. Today, we didn't unconfirm that. We'd have to break through that high. It was just an inside trading day, which is just telling us that that is once again more consolidation with this negative divergence there. IWM, on the other hand, was up 1.62%. So, it's seen some relative performance because one, there's a lot of energy stocks. There's a lot of financial stocks like regional banks. So, when you see the 10-year yield rise, typically a lot of the a lot of the times financials like that move and well, we saw energy kind of break out of this sorry IWM break out of that consolidation over here. Now, why am I saying that it's at a important time other than just looking at some basic technical analysis and that's because we're at a critical level here. That's S&P 500 gamma wall call wall at 6,000 and price can not that it can't get above it, but just be aware that if this remains the call wall, it's likely that price can get pinned and or push away from that. Now, traders are reaching out to 6100, so that's a positive sign. We'll see if that changes. So, if the market wants to press up higher, that would be one of the key levels to obviously hone in on. And if you see that here, 6,000 is that level. Where do we get pinned at today? We got pinned at 6,000 basically closing right on it. Above us is 6,100. That is actually in confluence with the upper quarterly expected move. So if the market were to just squeeze once again higher, that's actually a critical thing to watch for because this is known if especially if it reverses through that would be called a bull trap. Now that 6100 is also that call wall or that that second gamma level here that is growing and we have our upper monthly expected move slightly higher than that and while price actions at this critical level that's also in positive gamma above the flip line which is a you know a good sign right now and then this is also over the JPM collar which we have a new collar being rolling out here at the end of June for Q3. Now, what I found interesting here about if we were to squeeze up higher and this price action is if you actually zoom out, remember over here where we kind of dipped, kind of went sideways and then broke out. And this right here, if you go back to those videos, we talked about a massive bull trap, right? Massive bull trap could be forming. And if you just look right here, well, we came down, we squiggled around, and we're kind of breaking higher here. It's a very similar structure. You know, on the 22nd, I think we right over here, we talked about how this is kind of like this shakeout trade down here. where we talked to pain trade, then we talked about the FOMO trade, and then now we're kind of in that shakeout phase of a trade. So, yeah, I mean, we've seen the bull trap happen before. Not to say that this similar type of situation is going to happen, but just be aware once again, I want to reiterate that the upside is getting smaller as far as the reward goes and the downside risk is starting to grow. And once again, it's not just looking at the gamma walls and some of the technical patterns here, but there's also a lot of signal charts that are confirming this, too. If you look at the put to call ratio, you can see that the 10day moving average was in the red, right above below the red line. When it crossed back above, that typically tells us that we can consolidate and or pull back and then see the line's been going up here. Well, very similar here. We did the same thing. And guess what happened? The market consolidated. We broke higher. This thing continued up and then we started to sell off. And even back here going into 2022, what happened? We crossed through the red line indicating very bullish sentiment. We crossed back up through. We saw some weakness. We went higher. Bull trap. Bam. And we ended up going lower. So, I thought that was interesting there. But that's not the only thing, too. We also have the bearish divergence on the NASDAQ composite index on the bullish percent index. I guess we can say that we kind of had a bearish I guess divergence over here growing on the RSI. It's not as clean as this one in my opinion. the S&P 500. You can see here too, as we were pressing higher to all-time highs, we had less stocks above their 50-day moving average. And same with above their 200 day moving average. And same here, S&P 500's moving higher. We have less stocks above the 50-day moving average, less stocks above the 200 day moving average. So, we have a subtle divergence building. And then on top of that, yesterday we talked about the rate of change, the 10day rate of change between growth and value. And we have this divergence that's been building here on both the RSI and that was back in the going into 2025. We had that big divergence. We have one growing now and that led to the Q's kind of seeing some sell side. So are we potentially nearing that point where maybe we get a rotation out of what holds these markets together into something that might, you know, maybe more like like small cast we've been saying or potentially more safety type trade perhaps. Now if we take a look at the equal weight, you can see the same thing. We had a divergence here in equal weight as the S&P 500 pressed higher. We have a divergence here. Although albeit that this looks doesn't look really bearish, but it is still diverging right now. And you can see that also with the housing index. We had a lower high there, a higher high here. That led to some selling there in the S&P 500. And it's doing it again right now. SM uh the housing index is it was down today. Go figure. And then this the market was up higher. Now, I'd figure that the housing index was down today because why? probably because the yields were rising and there's a stronger negative correlation there. If we take a look at expected moves, what is the market pricing in for the next week? First foremost, let's just look at what it did within this week's expected move. Actually, though the week started right here, this was the upper expected move we talked about. Where did price go to? Right? We pulled down. We broke through this trend and we basically came right into the weekly expected move. And what did we do? We sold from it a little bit. We came back and we just doodled around. That happened to be in confluence with that upper daily V range. So, if I update you what the next daily trading day is going to be like, we're looking at 605 to 603. We're looking at 595 to 592 to the downside. And then the weekly expected move, which by the way, on Mondays, we sometimes do get outsized moves. So, it's important to watch these. But 580, I'm just going to round it to 590 and then 60850 to the upside. That's what the market's pricing in next week. So, overall things are bullish. Price is higher, right? There's not a really reason to get beared up here unless if price confirms it. So, in my opinion, what I'm currently doing, once again, I'm going to just reiterate what I did and what I told my Discord group and what I told you on the last video is that when price keeps pressing higher, right? So, the main thing that I said yesterday was creating if scenarios, what could happen? Where would I be more bearish? Right? Oh, I I probably if it gets under the flip line, I'm going to wait until it comes and tests some of these anchor VWOPS and see what happens there. But if it keeps going, I'm gonna still continue to look for strong stocks and then sell if price starts to creep higher, right? On on sell on the on the names that have been really, you know, stretching in my direction. And that's what I did today. You can see we had this big move here today in the S&P 500. So, what did I do? I started cutting and trimming some of my some of my positions right into there. And then I started to look at other positions that are tightening up that make sense that people may rotate into that they have not done so yet. Okay. So, let's go ahead and just kind of we'll go into some of those. Now, for those that don't know these, I have a swing trading community. It's part of the Discord. There's some day traders in there. There's all kinds of stuff in here. It's only $9 a month. You can join annually. And I'm going to walk you through some of the stuff that's in there. For example, I have the entire comprehensive set of query query bots and a trading text where you can actually go in and type in various commands and get all types of interesting data from market net flow to gamma exposure levels to darkpool levels to unusual flow to whale targets. All kinds of actually really cool stuff that you can get for various equities. But they also include various bots where they have some various types of auction flow. And then more recently, what's not on here is I just launched my Asherbot. This is my first bot that I've had created. Named it after my first son. You see the A and then the S. That's our last name there. And what this does is freaking insane. I love it so much. You can now get weekly expected moves for any stock, equity, or ETF that's optionable. And it gives you the upper level, the lower level, and then you can do daily. This is based off of my eyeball range, right? That's something that I've been sharing on this show and it's yeah, I just I just I'm blown away by it. It's really cool. And then on top of that, I included also the ability to look at eyeball premium and discount over various days versus a one-mon. And then also the standard deviation to it. So you can see in short like what this is, right? I have an explainer video in there, but I'm just so excited. So I'm talking about it now before we get into the stocks. But you can you you can watch the trend of the premium or the discount change and you can kind of look at the table. This is in the help me file where what's price doing relative to this and it just tells you whether things are getting very complacent and or you're seeing more fear in the market. Another thing that we have is obviously the watch list which is and the tight list. So the watch list includes kind of all these names and I have a big watch list and then within there I go every week and I also drill it down to a tight list which are stocks that are contracting and that's some of the stocks that I'm going to be showing you today. I give some trade ideas which are just some mostly charts from my trade from my tight list. I give monthly quarterly expected moves the weekly expected moves although Asher is now posting that and then daily expected moves for the ones that do have daily options. And then the zones chart, which is this, but it also includes the S&P 100, global currencies, all types of stuff. And this is actually something that I'll be playing around with utilizing actually my zones chart because when things start to move to the upper end or lower ranges here, I want to see if we're getting a deeper discount andor higher premium on those things. Okay, so we got obviously a lot of stuff within there. I just wanted to uh share that because one, it's only $9 a month for all of this stuff or $90 if you sign up for the year. Okay, so a lot of tools, a lot of resources, well worth it in my opinion. I want to go ahead now and hop into some of the trade ideas from the tight list. And I'm going to start here with Rivian. Rivian broke out from a pretty pretty nice trend here and then I anchored a volume weight average price to this most recent low. We saw a nice move from that level and price made a pretty nice pullback here and it's pretty light volume overall, right? So, we saw, you know, we saw nice volume on the run up here and then the pullback seems to be pretty well managed, right, with lighter volume and it's pulling into this VWOP. So, my thought here is if we can break out, I think that that's worth a trade with a nice stop-loss down here. You know, if you want to give it more room, you can give it more room. But if it were to break down right before or even stop and break down whatever, I get out for a very, very tight risk. And then if it turns back around, I can always look to potentially re-enter it so I don't miss that particular trade. But not only is it a nice tight pullback, you also have an inside trading day here, which lets me to believe that we're probably going to get somewhat of a bigger move. Whether that's up or down, I don't know, but from, you know, my perspective, I'm a long-sided equity trader, so I'd like it to catch it to the upside. I'm not going to short after the pullback here on lighter volume. I would be looking for the strength. And I wouldn't necessarily hold it all the way to 17, right? Just, you know, buy this my risk and then hold and hope. I would, you know, maybe take a little bit off and, you know, play it as it goes, right? or maybe if it breaks out in a big day, I'll update my stop to break even or under the low of that daily candle or so forth. So, there's a lot of ways you can approach that. It just we need more data for if it actually goes in our direction or breaks down. TEM, this is one of those Nancy Pelosi stocks. This has also been contracting pretty nicely here. We have a bunch of higher lows. We have a bunch of lower highs. And then recently, we saw a nice big volume day here after kind of this sell-off kind of day. So this first off it was flagging here and we broke out and then it flushed down and then it quickly recovered and now we have price tightening back up right here. Tightening not only here but also in a larger pattern with volume kind of drying up here too. So TEM, you know, if this breaks from this, tightens up a little bit more. Hey, perhaps this could be another one of those high-flying names where we get a nice nice move very quickly where we can risk a little to potentially earn a decent amount on a return on capital in a shorter period of time. Another one here is TPR and I think this is tempropedic. I can't quite remember. But just look at here how we saw this nice reversal moved up higher and now pretty much volume's drying up to you know shriveling up here as price action's getting very very tight and then we just had an inside trading day here too. So my thought is we're probably going to see some sort of a range expansion and I would hope that it breaks out to the upside because if it breaks to the downside I'm going to ignore it and wait to see if it just sets back up again. But another good-looking name, right, with very, you know, tight risk to potentially, right, good reward if it starts breaking back through. Another one that's pretty interesting to me, another small cap name, a Pelaton P. This one is, this one's interesting to me because I've been kind of on the talking about small caps recently, and this would be one. So, if we're going to get some squeezes in these names, I'm starting to see some pretty decentsized volume build in here. And price action's getting tight. So, today was an inside trading day. The prior day was an inside trading day. The prior day. So, now we have about a couple of bars of inside trading. And it's also compressing within here as we're seeing some, you know, pops within this kind of base of larger amounts of volume. So, I don't know if there's going to be a potentially, you know, breakout or anything here, but I want to be a part of it if it does break out because I mean, once again, the risk can be pretty small. And if this thing squeezes up to $10, I mean, that's a huge move. Like, for example, right, I don't need to take a big trade, but you know, if it does something like this, that's I'm risking one unit here to potentially get two to three units. It's pretty nice stuff. That's all I got for you on today's Stock Market Brief Show. Hope it helps out, gives you some insight. I'll see you on the next",
