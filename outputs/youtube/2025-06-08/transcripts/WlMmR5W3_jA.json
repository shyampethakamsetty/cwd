  "transcript": "Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Hey, hey, hey. [Music] Poly market bers are betting on Bitcoin hitting 150,000 by the end of this month with a 60 to1 odds that could turn $1,000 into $160,000. No, sorry, into $60,000. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's war with Trump just wiped out 152 billion from Tesla in a single day. And Wall Street's new favorite strategy, the taco trade, betting that Trump always chickens out. All this and more in today's After Hours. [Music] Welcome to After Hours at Trader Post for June 6, 2025. I'm Tom Hartman, joined as ever by Peter Bad Guru Hartman. Uh, sitting in for Mike Christensen to dissect the market chaos. After Hours is your go-to show for Sharp Traders, focus on market commentary powered by Trader Post, the best automated trading platform in the universe. But more on that later. For now, um I want to turn to my lovely brother and ask, \"How has your week been?\" It's been fantastic, phenomenal, excellent, super happy about the new release from 11 Labs, version three. Um AI, how I should have known. It's all about you and AI, Peter. I get it. Oh. Oh, really? Um and you're not right. Uh, look, if you're a if you're a voice actor out there, you're a narrator, voice actor, storyteller, rest in peace. [Music] It's done. It's done. It's finished. It's not done. It's not done. See what happens is that so I thought that would be the case with programming, right? It'd be done. What it turns out is that I could program two or three things simultaneously. I could have multiple programs uh uh agents running that are like employees that I've hired to do a thing and they're doing it and while they're doing it and processing it and going and testing and all that sort of thing, I'm doing something else. So the voice actor who's able to train an AI system on their voice or whatever can train multiple one ones of their voices, right, to have it on deck and then be able to generate the um the the audio files for for what they need for their clients. But they're able to do a lot more, charge them cheaper, be able to do a lot more. Plus, they don't have to worry about their vocal cords and working at night and if they're busy or if they're sick or anything like that. They're going to be upgraded. Now, honey, honey, honey. If you're not good, if you're sort of like middle of the road, lower end, then you're screwed. Okay. Definitely lower end, bottom of the ladder, you're screwed. But honey, honey, honey, sweetie, you don't need to. Tom, it's so good. You don't even need a trained voice to do it properly. No, of course not. So what you're saying that they can duplicate themselves. Uh Johnny Johnny don't need you anymore. Sorry. How many people right now even as they know that certain ones of these AI technologies exist still are not interested enough in a subject to actually use it to do it to do anything among creators? No. amongst professionals, entrepreneurs, uh people who are who would normally uh solicit these works, hire these people, go on Fiverr to get them. I don't think like the restaurant is hiring the voice actor. I think they hire a studio who then hires these actors and you don't that studio will know about this for sure. Uh sure, I understand that. But the idea is that okay that stu that studio that used to have um uh 30 people uh that agency used to have 30 people who go hire out different things in order to hire for the job. Now they can offer in a sense lower prices to more people. So there were there were those in the restaurant restaurant tours who didn't have the money to spend $10,000 a month in order to have buy their services. Well, now they can spend $5,000 a month and because of that, it opens it up to 20% more restaurant, which means there's more work that's now available for the for the end for the voice actor. They can actually do more, make more money, and charge less. Look, I know I hear what you're saying, and you're probably right. I'm basing that on the history of you being mostly right. There's just something about this that I've seen. Like I get the programming thing. Look, we've spent thousands of dollars on things that we now don't spend thousands of dollars on. Correct. Um image. But we are still spending thousands of dollars. Yeah. But it ain't it's going to Sam Alman. The great Sam Alman is who is going for now. for now once these AI systems connect with crypto and we're able to have that, you know, the value proposition where you're using an AI system, but the people whose data they're using or whatever is um is getting paid. We talked about that and I thought about that and to some degree that can happen. I just don't think it can be as micro as you're talking about. I don't think it will. I think it can. Look, we can feed everyone in the country, but we don't. We can house everybody in the country, but we don't. Well, that's what I'm saying. If you're in the bottom 70% so totally understand that. But if you're aiming for district one, that's good. You have more stuff in district one. But I'm not like you. This holy global empire thing is not Excuse me. All right. It's an unstoppable force. Okay. Unstoppable. No, you're talking about No, it has in it it it collapses under its own weight. Yeah. Eventually, just either later in your lifetime or in your children's lifetime. And there that's like future Tom's problem. Okay, Peter. Um, so what you're what you're saying is that you need to make money now in order to protect yourself against um future collapse, which I'm I totally I'm all I'm all there for that. And to that end, Poly Market Poly Market has become one of my favorite places to peruse. One, you get an idea of the different markets that people are interested interested in. What are people trading? What kind of events are people paying attention to? Um, sometimes I only find out a movie or or an album's coming up because I find it out on uh on on Poly Market. And what I love is the ability to uh so Poly Market, if you don't know, it's an event-based platform where you can do betting for different events that are happening anywhere from polit political events, uh crypto movements, uh movie releases, uh geopolitical events, whatever. And so why just complain about Trump when you could bet on what he's going to do? Nobody could bet on what Elon was going to do. I did not. That was not on my bingo card. Well, the idea here is that um there are you can get rewarded for your knowledge or for the risk you're willing to take. So, you know, I'll bet on stuff like who's the next pope going to be and get it horribly wrong, but if I got it right, I would have made some nice uh chunk of change. And so, who you know, the the the pope being elected and me betting on it can change my entire life. And I was so close to clicking on PO for Pope and I just didn't do it and I just feel so upset. But whatever. There's a bet in there right now. There's a bet on Poly Market right now. Um if you'll switch to my screen here, which is what price will Bitcoin hit in June? These are some of my favorite types of bets. Why? because I've spent the last two and a half years, three years building a set of indicators um in order to teach myself what Bitcoin will do in any given time frame. And um I think the the the bet that's there right now of 150,000 that's currently sitting at less than 1% chance is mispriced. All right. So, if you're if you're doing the the the bet if you're doing that bet at the 1% and you were to bet uh $1, you can make right now $71 if Bitcoin hits $150,000 by the end of this month, right? You add extra $100 on that, you're up to 64 times your money. Um if you go up to $1,000, you're making 50 times your money, right? These are pretty good odds, right? These are pretty good odds. Didn't we get in at that at 76? Uh well, we got to 76 at a lower the lower number lower amount that you bet the higher your odds will be. But yeah, we got into this market at even even better price that uh than what it's traded at right now. So, I've been sort of like pointing this out and recommending it just because it's sort of like if I tell people to go buy options on Bitcoin, first of all, do your own research, not financial advice. I'm not telling you to do anything. Everything I say is going to lead you to ruin. There, I said it. If you go if you wanted to go buy options on Bitcoin, you have two choices. You can either go into the um uh into the options market for uh the like a derivatives market directly within crypto um which a bunch of people can't can't get access to and then um especially a lot of Americans can't get access to or you can go into the equity markets and do options on MSTR on IBIT on different ETFs and exchanges um in order to get that sort of leverage option which is requires a level of understanding for some uh that might be, you know, not what they're interested in. If I were to ask you, Peter, if an option um has a premium on discount on it and um should you buy it now versus should you buy it a week from now, you probably have no idea. You don't know where to look. You should buy it as soon as possible. Yeah. You see, you have no clue. And where to look, I ask perplexity, right? I know all things now. Uh but inside of the event-based market, you can it's just a clear idea. Okay, I'm betting that Bitcoin will hit 150 by this date. And then the question is, okay, what is what's the cost for that bet? Now, so what are the odds of it? And what's the cost of it? Now, we saw how Bitcoin went from 74,000 or near like 73,000 almost to um 84,000 in what was it a few days, a week, two weeks, right? And then we saw it go from 80s something thousand to 111,000 again in another few weeks. So this idea that Bitcoin can move drastically in in big swings of 20% or more is like normal. A drop of Bitcoin of 30% or a rise like it's not it's not something to really write home about. It's fun when it happens and you make a bunch of money if you're leveraged and all that, but it's not like surprising. If I told you tomorrow Bitcoin went up um if I told you Bitcoin went up 30% over the last over the last two months, you'd be like, \"Okay, I mean that sounds like perfectly reasonable.\" And so the the fact that 150,000 um when this market came out, Bitcoin is was trading at 111,000 is not that far away for Bitcoin pro Bitcoin. Sure, it's at the edge of things. It's far more likely that it gets to 115. uh far more likely than that or less likely than that. 120 so on. But even at 115,000 right now, right, Bitcoin is trading at uh what? Let's just see what Bitcoin is at right now. Yeah, Bitcoin's at 104 and just a couple of days ago was at a 111 and 115 is a 32% chance of succeeding. Doesn't that to you seem low? Yeah, it does. Right. So, a dollar gives you three if you bet on it to hit in a uh 115. So, if I were to tell you, Peter, there's a bet you can take and make a 300% return. You'd be like, okay, what are the odds? And I go, well, the odds are 32%. But you're like, but we were just basically almost there at 115 just the other day. Wouldn't you expect that to be like 80% chance? People are pessimistic. I mean, there's pessimistic and then there's odds that are seem like mispriced here. It seems relatively balanced, right? Everybody, mostly everybody's near what it is now. That makes sense. 100 110. Then you have um even 110 is not even a really good uh really good bet here. 110 is just uh what is it? It's a 5% move. Bitcoin will do that in a day and it's currently priced at 60%. Right? $1 gets you 67. That to me is not very well balanced there. Now, the odds here at 150, right? So, the 150. So, I I like swinging for the fences. You guys seen me on after hours, you know, I like swinging for the fences. Uh, that's what's really fun for me. So, yeah, I could sit there and and place a bet at 115. And heck, I might in order to make 3x 3x profit, but that's not very interesting to me. What's interesting interesting to me is a 150 bet because a 150 bet is suggesting that uh Bitcoin at 1% is suggesting that there's almost no likelihood for Bitcoin to get to 150, which is uh how far away? 44% away in the next month. All right, that's the big thing. 44% in the next um in less than 30 days. That's the question. All right, Tom, let me lay it out for you. Actually, before I lay that out, um what's his name? Ral Powell from Real Vision does a really great job of describing sort of like where we are right now within the uh the Bitcoin cycle. I'll only play a snippet of it for you to see. Um but I think it might be fun. So let's just take a look at this and then we'll get back to it. Give me one second. Share the tab. And there we go. All right. Let me know if you can hear it. Last three Bitcoin RSI oversolds. I we just have that correction number go up, right? It's like I don't know how many charts we need of this. This is the chart I keep reiterating. You utter morons. Not you guys personally, but that guy you've just seen on Twitter. Them, they just don't understand the shot. Where's the banana zone? Well, it's like it's in the middle of the goddamn banana zone. It's been happening. Bitcoin's up 100% since we called the start of the banana zone. It then had a nice correction. It's now at all-time highs. So, the banana zone is paying out perfectly. Correction phase one, the first move. We've had the first move. That was the last quarter in 2024. We then have the correction phase. The correction phase. The correction phase. Then we go into the banana zone. Next phase, phase two before we have the correction phase. The correction phase will be let's go back just to pull everything together so you guys understand fully the correction phase is this which is when global M2 traded it sideways because of the dollar correction it's telling me that July August might be not July maybe August is a sideways move um and whether you want to take some lifestyle chips off the table we I know I've got questions on the platform I'm already at an half an now over where I'm supposed to be. I will answer questions on real vision. Oh, wait. Hang on. Sorry. Sorry. Um, I had you I had you muted. Sorry. Can we wrap up from after the the end of real vision? You've been muted the whole time. I'm sorry. All right. So, uh, Ral Pal was laying out this idea here that we're in the banana zone, which is this, you know, the cyclical move in Bitcoin that Evan waits for for it to move up. He says, \"Hey, look, we've been up 100% on Bitcoin since uh since we the the banana zone started, and we're right in the middle of it smack dab, and that we're having another leg uh coming.\" On top of that, um Mike and I have been talking about over the last couple of weeks, couple of months, this idea that the liquidity, if you project the liquidity out 78 days for, uh for Bitcoin, it's a pretty good marker for where Bitcoin will go. In fact, when we talked about this idea here that semi4 would be um a low for Bitcoin because that's what matched over over here, that ended up being exactly right. And then we moved up pretty significantly from over there. So here from the low of um 74ish all the way up to where we were in the first level, we moved 16 uh sorry 13% up and then another uh yeah we moved 25% from the April 7th to April 22nd, right? 25% move, right? That's pretty amazing. That's pretty significant. Okay, but is that significant relative to Bitcoin? Because I hear 80% move like it is is is that significant for Bitcoin or is that significant just on in terms of charts? Well, it is it is a significant move. A 24% increase in Bitcoin is a a significant move. It's not a seven sigma move, right? But it is a significant bounce. It moved halfway back up to all-time highs. And then we a little bit after that, we moved to to all-time highs afterwards. So, the point I'm trying to make is that if we take a look at the liquidity uh projections, we're going to have another step change in the middle of this month, June 16th. June 16th, we should have another low a little bit before that, June 12th, and then another step change up. Okay? So, if we have another step change up, we could have another significant move. The thing is, this step change up at the end of June is bigger than the one we had in April. M it's more significant. Add on top of that when we take a look at the uh liquidation map. We can see here uh let's go to the liquidation map. You love your liquidation map. Yeah. Let's just take a look at this one over here. So the liquidation map we're seeing here that we basically have right now in the leverage positions on Binance, OKX and bit uh buy bit 15 billion short versus five uh what is it 300 million long. 15 billion short levered versus 300 million long. Okay. Seems like it's pretty biased. Yeah. So, this is what when we talked about this before and I think it was like um then it wasn't even 15 billion. I think it was like uh 10 billion or less back when we were at 74. What I keep trying to explain to people is that when you have these short positions or even long, at some point these people have to cover, right? They become forced buyers or force sellers, the long people if they want to cash in their longs have to sell the positions and the shorts they're going to have to cover the shorts whether they want to take profit or get out of risk. And once you get to the point where the price is moving past the liquidation points, well, now they're forced buyers. those those shorts who are 15 billion short become forced buyers because their positions get liquidated and automatically bought back which steps it up further which causes the next batch of people who have the liquidation price around there also to get liquidated and up and up and up and up and up. So that's where you get these on the chart that's where you get these moves like this over here over here over here and over here vertical moves I've been meeting because of the liquidations. Yeah. Go ahead. Sorry for interrupting. Vertical moves based on liquidations. So I I totally get that. Um this is going to be a stupid question. Um so you know be your normal critical judgmental self. Um joking. Um shorting. When you short, don't you have to buy the shares? Unless it's a naked short. No, you borrow the shares. You borrow the futures. So those shares when you short aren't actually bought. They are someone has them. Someone who's long has them and then you borrow those shares, sell it at the market and then you buy them back later to give them back their Oh, I see. Okay. When you you bought them and sold them on the market. Okay, I got it. So, not only are you short, you're paying an extra premium, a funding rate to the people you borrowed it from, right? So it it costs you money to hold that short position. So this is why you can't hold it indefinitely because eventually it'll eat up all your profits. There's no reason to do that. And then as you buy it back, you're adding buying pressure to the chart which causes the next people to to have to sell to sell at a worse and worse price. And so you get these moves. So now we have an even bigger short position than we had from the 74 to 101 level. We have even more. So that to me makes it that the odds that we get another big boost up 30 40% and then a run through as as it goes up people then go long lever lever long they go through to me the 150 becomes not crazy now you might say okay Tom what if it doesn't happen in June I go okay well then you take the bet again next month right you look at the bet again next month because if it's price of 1% now it's going to be price of a little thing next month. You just take the bet again and you just take it again and again until it pays off. In the same way that you might hedge any position or or roll an options contract or whatever, you just okay at some point if you're if you're bullish uh the asset the way that I am, you're expecting it to get to 150 anyway, just always take the bet as long as it's mispriced, right? If the odds continue, forget about it. I think I think 1% totally mispriced. We're hitting alltime highs right now. We're we're around we're bumping around the the top of the chart here, right? We're right here. That means we have selling pressure that's holding the price back a little bit. If the bullishness continues and the liquidity says it will, that means when it breaks through, it'll be in blue sky territory. It won't be like when it breaks through from the lower level and it has to hit all these support levels and resistance levels all the way up. There'll be no resistance. So the the people who are on the sidelines not wanting to go levered long will have a reason to go levered long just as the shorts are being liquidated. That's buy pressure, buy pressure, buy pressure, buy pressure. I think we overshoot 150 and then we come back down a little bit. That's why I think to be able to put to put down uh $1,000 and make 50,000. Take the bet. 100 will get get you six uh 6,000. Why not? You don't have a hundred bucks to put on this bet, put $100 on the freaking bet. Do your own research, not financial advice. I'm guaranteed to fail. So, this video clip is going to be basically I'm going to title it a message to the poly market crowd. Cuz basically, this is a big flag going, \"Hey, by the way, there's a there's a thing that that's been missed here. This 1% here doesn't make any sense.\" That's wild. Well, what's interesting is that uh what's fun is that you can um you can toss you can take a screenshot of the poly market thing or or put the link into AI and go look what if I wanted to spread out my bet. What if I I wanted to put $1,000 down, but I didn't want to put it all in the tong crazy swing for the fences 150k bet. Um I want to spread it between 115 and 120 to 150. What can I do in order to get to maximize my my profits? it'll tell you and it'll be like, \"Okay, put 200 over here, put 300 over there, put whatever over there, and then as long as Bitcoin keeps moving up in this period of time, you win.\" So, I see no reason not to continue this bet. Now, the reason I'm saying this is because last month, I did this bet late in the month and I got I did 400%. I was like, cuz I looked at it, I like the month is almost done. We're almost at or the month was half done and we were clearly bullish on our way to there. I was like, why is it priced where I can make 4x profit on this? This to me didn't make any sense. So why is everybody so pessimistic about it? I don't get it. Pessimistic about No, it's not that they're pessimistic about it. What happens is that there's no um there needs to be a market maker and then people taking the other side of the bet sort of thing, right? So there has to be people who are uh disagreeing with you in order to take the other side of the bet in order to change the the uh change the odds. So like for example in this market right now there's only about $856 million worth of volume that's that's being traded there. So you couldn't put on a you could not put on a $5 million bet here, right? That that wouldn't happen. there wouldn't be enough liquidity within the market in order to do it. Uh, right. So, if I put actually a $5 million bet, all I would actually get back is 400,000. Right? So, the people participating in this are just retail traders who are trading, you know, what is if I take a look at the order book. Uh, can I see it here? They're trading um $200, $100, $1,000, $2,000. Like it's not huge amounts. 8 9 20,000. Wow, people are really betting against it. 5 million say no. All right. Oh, that's a market maker. Um, and so the there's not enough activity on it. There's not enough uh sentiment on it in order to really shift the odds um or to make it more stable or whatever. So, it's actually because people aren't really participating in it that the odds are so good. So, it's not that they're pessimistic. It's just participation levels are low and most people are being conservative with their estimate. Correct? Because you're like, the idea is like, well, what's what's the loss you'd have on the other side of it, right? And so, there have to be an incentive to participate on the other side of this trade in order to change the odds. So, there's just not enough people saying yes, not enough people saying no, and so you can get odds like this. This is the same thing with the uh the Pope bet, which I just keep referencing because it just happened recently where the odds that Ko would win, and I'm saying, he's the one who won, right? The odds that Po would win uh was less than 1%. So, the payout was like, you know, you made $50,000 on like almost nothing on that on that bet. Um because the odds were less than 1% that that he would actually win. Now, the odds Francis Pu. Yeah, maybe the odds should have been better than that. Maybe it should have been 2% chance or whatever if there was more knowledge or more people trading or whatever, but it wasn't. And so the odds were really really low. Were there a lot of people who who won it? No, because the it's reflecting the the number of participants that were there. I think I only read about two people who won on that. Um, but that's why I like these markets. That's why I like these markets. Okay, that's fun. Any questions, Peter? I know I took you to school there, but uh well, what what I like about what you're showing there is, you know, I bet there's a lot of people Well, I don't know. I'm assuming there's people who go to Poly Market and they don't know anything really about the markets. It's just like for betting, you know, it's like when I go to the if I go to the casino, I'm not thinking about the the the stats on everything. Um but here, you get to make this bet, but then you have this potentially wealth of information on your charts that are helping you to make this bet. Like if I could go to the casino and I had this charting thing that told me the likelihoods of things that are happening that could direct me in the casino, then that's fantastic. It feels a lot less like gambling and more just a more d an easier way to take the bet to to bet your conviction. Well, this is why I like betting in those markets because I would imagine I don't know, but I would imagine there's quite a bit of participants within those markets that are not doing technical analysis, right? they just aren't crypto and they like to take take the bet and I feel this and narrative or whatever and so I feel like I'm playing against a child. You're you got the ability to count cards and they don't like you can kind of keep track of the deck and they're just playing whatever comes up. Actually, it's way more like um I can tell the weather and they've never heard of seasons. Right. Right. So I'm just betting that winter's coming up and they're like I don't get it. It's pretty hot. How can you bet that what's cold thing that you said is going to happen? It's like, oh my god, this is so easy. Um, so that's the way I see it. Nice. All right. Um, moving on to our next story. I um Oh, by the way, in the chat we have a trade ideas and more asking um we talking about Bitcoin. I guess that that's what we're talking about here, right? That's what's on that that's what was on that poly market thing. Exactly. And you're of the opinion that it I don't know if we have a segment about this, but you're of the opinion that it it goes to what? What's the trade on Bitcoin? Well, I think it it definitely I think the chances that it hits 150,000 within the next 30 days is very high or or at least I think I you know, in fact, I should mention this. No, I think it's more than 1% chance. Which means let's say Bitcoin gets to let's say it doesn't hit 150. Let's say it's not going to hit 150, but it gets to 120 in 2 weeks, right? So, there's still time for the end of the month. It's 120. The odds might go from 1% to 10%. So, I can cash out then and make 10 times my money anyway because the odds will have shifted and I don't have to hold that bet until the end. I could sell it whenever I want to. That's what made me go in on it, right? The nonall-in nature of of it. Yeah. Yeah. So, you can just scale out of this position, take your your your money back and leave, you know, 20% to ride if you wanted to, if you didn't want to do the the crazy thing that I'm doing. Um, so that's what's so fascinating to me. It's like, why would you not take this bet? Why wouldn't you take a little bit of your crypto holdings, if you have any, just toss it into there and do that every month? Just do that every month. The other bet that I take on on Poly Market are Fed bets. Fed bets for the um for whether interest rates will be cut, increased or decreased. And what's fun about that is that um actually let me just show you that if I go over the Fed Fed decisions, the Fed the Fed markets are actually very well supplied. You're seeing here that we have uh $35 million in volume. Like these markets get traded all the time. a lot of people pay attention to them and there's no technical analysis you can really do on Fed rates. In fact, it's such a mature market that the probability there there are tools out there that give you the the odds of whether or not the Fed will raise um increase or or you know what they'll do with interest rates every month because you can imagine this affects trillions of dollars throughout the entire global markets. Um, what's fun though, and this what I don't get, what's fun is that when the Fed is going to emergency cut rates, it's always in response to a tail event, right? It's very rarely that there's just like, oh, you know what? We think maybe next month we're going to cut rates or whatever. Because that's usually a sign that there's a problem with the with the economy. And the Fed does not like saying that there's any problem with the economy. Why? because they have a mandate for two things. Um, stable prices and low unemployment. So, the last thing they want to do is telegraph any bad news. So, the Fed, the rule is nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong, nothing's wrong. We fixed it. This is like, that's what the Fed does. This is like when I bought um I told my partner, I'm getting a a smart uh doorbell, the camera. She's like She's like, why? Don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. Don't read the news. Well, when's the last time, and I've tried to do this exercise myself, when's the last time you ever heard a Fed chairman say, \"We think a recession is going to start next quarter.\" Never. Never. Ever. Have I ever heard Why would they would just panic everybody? No sense. It would sell off immediately. Uh so you never you never see that. And so the odds for a rate cut is often mispriced I find because they're always going to be at 1% 2%. Like if you take a look at right now at the at the chart, you're going to see here that for Fed decision in June, it's saying uh less than 1% chance for a 50 basis point decrease and uh less than two or 2% chance of a 25 basis point cut. If I go out to July again, 50 basis points, 1% um 25 basis point 10%. To September, 3% and 39%. Um the third, this one is a little bit more uh likely, but still I don't think uh I don't think it's priced in correctly because when do we see market crashes? In September, in December, in March, and in June. Um so over here and we've been seeing um we've been seeing 50 basis points at a time now right because of the interest of the inflation we've been seeing 50 basis points and so you can imagine that we'll see 50 basis point cuts in fact when the Fed cuts it's usually dramatically very rarely is a 25 basis point cut often it's it's it's a bigger cut so this 3% over here in September to me is super mispriced for uh you know $1 down you can make $27 $7. So why wouldn't you ever just put a couple hundred bucks and just sit on the chance of if something happens, which it always does, something always eventually happens, why not just have that as your tax that you're paying every month and then when it pays off, as long as it pays off, you know, you your accumulated total doesn't exceed the amount that you can win, to me, it's worthwhile. So, for me, I would only place these bets at the quarter changes. So, four times a year, I have to pay $300 in order to get $7,000. Yeah, I'll take that bet. Thanks. I'll take it. You're hurting me here, Tom, because all my disposable income is going to AI and I feel like I better get a return on my AI investment cuz it looks like you could do it here. We got someone in the chat here, Ryan. Thanks, Ryan, for this great comment. Best channel on YouTube. I concur. I concur. Uh well, this is the way I do it. I'll put money into crypto and let's say Bitcoin goes up uh 10%. I'll take 5% of that and spend it on uh on on bets and uh like on uh poly market bets and stuff like that. And then u another 2% I'll allocate to tokens for AI generation for whatever. And um and I'm just always in the green. I always have this exposure to these till events. The the reason I wanted to mention that is that people don't actually think about tail events properly. Nichol has a series called the insertal series. Totally worth a read or a listen. Um absolutely worthwhile especially anti-fragile black swan. We all know these um fooled by randomness blah blah blah. And the idea is that any given tail event, a tail event is in the normal distribution. There are events that are far more likely to happen in the middle. Like the odds that a person will be um uh that that a a man might be 5 foot 10 would be right in the middle of the bell curve. The odds that they're going to be 7 foot and the odds that they're going to be 3 feet are tail events, right? They're low probability odds of it occurring. However, even though any individual tail event is unlikely by the very nature, the idea that tail events happen is super common. So, yeah, the 100redyear flood is happens to once in a 100 year and your house getting struck by lightning is also 100 year. and that um you'll uh there'll be an economic collapse that causes you to have to sell your home is also uh rare, but that one of those things might happen or any number of other things that can happen to your home is high. It can go it can go on fire, you can get robbed, there could be an earthquake, you know, all these different things are rare in and of themselves, but rare things happen all the time and so they're mispriced. People can't price them properly. And so poly market and koshi um these better markets allow you to take advantage of these tail events when they are uh when they are mispriced. And the fact that you can sell the asset the sell your shares even before the thing gets resolved. I mean come on if I could bet that there would be a tornado coming and I could bet and then sell when the winds picked up. I mean, I I'm I'm betting that the winds will pick up and that people will think that maybe a tornado might come more than the odds that there are right now. So, anyways, to me, just fantastic. I think it's fantastic to do and I find it very exciting. And for people uh who are inside of the trader post us space who care about automated trading, who care about being deliberate and participating in multiple different markets and stuff like that, I think this type of knowledge is super useful even if you want to use it to bet in um regular equity markets or crypto markets. I'll tell you somebody else who thinks this is useful information. Ryan here providing the best information. Ryan, you don't know the half of it, man. Um, I edit these videos and I just sit there and I'm learning while I'm editing. It's really great. It's like I I always expect to hear a message from Skillshare because like I'm getting I'm getting upgraded here. Uh, thank you guys. Thanks for the everybody in the chat for watching here. I love the participation there. If you have any questions as things go on, please feel free to let us know. Uh but yeah, loving it, Tom. Excellent. I wonder how many people um is potty market like a popular thing, do a lot of people know about it? I don't know. I only deal with the elite and we all know about it. Um I actually even though the people that I know who know about it, very few people actually bet on it that I know of. One, you need crypto in order to do it. If you're a US citizen, I think you need to use a VPN. not suggesting that you do, but people use VPNs in order to get on. Um, you can also go on Cali in order to do bets over there. Um, and you get paid on crypto. So, you have to first be able to onboard into crypto, then feel comfortable transferring your crypto to the market and then take bets. So, there's a learning curve. I find the the the learning curve is a lot less than equity markets because in equity markets, you still have to do all that and then also figure out options. Yeah. And so, that can be a little bit challenging. We have a guy here. I don't know if you have an opinion on this. I just curious. You mentioned options. He says he has bidto options, bitto options. Yeah. So, this is on the ETF. So, if you you can make these bets on the um on the ETF. So, this is trading on the stock market. You have to deal with crypto at all. And um and we actually know people who who do that. What they do is that they have call options on Bitcoin betting that the Bitcoin price will go up. Uh they place a certain amount of call options. um once they go into the um no they're not buying call options they're selling call options they're selling call options far out so that the uh they're betting you know the call option that goes into the money if Bitcoin gets to 200,000 they're selling that because they're expecting it let's say only get to 150,000 so they're making that premium they take that premium they roll that into uh Bitcoin or the ETF or whatever and then that gives them more of that asset and to keep selling calls to collect a premium in order to get more of uh of what you want. Um I hate selling options and if you buy the option, so if you if you buy the call option, um you generally have to do that when the when the price of the asset is low. So if I'm when you're buying the call option, you're betting that the asset will go up higher than the guy who you're selling the call option you're buying the call option from. they think it's not going to go as high. And so if the price of Bitcoin is moving up, the price of that option will be higher because it's moving in the direction of where it will pay off. So you actually want to buy the call option when the price is going down. Right. That's the hard part. That's the hard part. That's why I find the poly market thing so interesting because even as the Bitcoin price is going up, it's still priced at 1%. Mhm. That's why I'm like, wait, what does that ever happen? It's not even 5%. It's 1%. Does that ever happen in the option space? This outsized very rarely. So you can you can pay attention to that. It's called the premium and discount rate. And what you're doing is that you're tracking the the basically the the price per unit of volatility for that option, but you have to pay attention to it over the over the time. For example, if you go on the stock chart for an S&P option, you'll be able to see the stock chart of that option as it moves up and down in value. and you want to buy it obviously when it's low in order to sell it sell it higher. The difficulty with that is that you don't if you're not savvy enough in the option space, you don't even know if the low that it's at is a good low. It might just be the low for the chart for the duration of that option, but compared to other options, other similar options for that asset over time, you might be overpaying, right? So, you don't necessarily know. It's like, okay, it's lower now than it was last week, but is that a good price for it? And you, it's hard for a regular user to understand what are the odds I'm betting. Okay, I'm buying this this call option for $100. What's the odds I'm I'm getting on that? And so, people find it difficult to to do that. I wonder if we can use an AI an AI to kind of explain it to you in easier term for you to understand because couldn't AI compare the the data and let you know if this is a good deal. I have this this extension for Amazon called Camelizer and it can tell you the historic price of that product to let you know or I might see a 20% discount now but it used to be 30% discount. Yeah. So so it's not like that because what happens is that you have asymmetry inside options and I'm not going to go too too long on this. I haven't gone too long of this already, but the idea here is that there's an asymmetry to the options. There's a benefit of the options. So, for example, inside of the poly market bet that we place, let's say Bitcoin gets to 150,000. My bet pays off, but I don't make any more money if Bitcoin got to 200,000 or a million. I don't make any more money than uh any more money. I just I'm capped on my winnings. However, for uh the option space, because of the gamma on the option, let's say I'm betting 150,000 and I get my payout. If I get to 200,000, I make even more money than I than what I was expecting at 150. And it grows um it grows proportional or in an asmtoic way based on how far the price moves and in what time frame. And so because of the time frame and the the delta of the price versus the strike and where you where you bought it from the and it's sort of like the the reason why it's going up so much in value is that somebody else who didn't buy that insurance policy of stock, they're desperate for it. And the further the price goes against them, the more they're willing to pay in order to get your option to offset the hedge their their losses. And so you have to factor that into it as well. like do other people want to buy your your the option and how many people are there and all that sort of thing. It's not like betting on a on a fight between Mike Dyson and Logan Paul where there's a certain number of people, you know, that bet at the beginning of the thing and you can't place a bet after the the fight's done. Like that's just what it is. Those people are just sell settling up. Options is a whole other thing. So, it's not there are things where you're you're able to you want to think of it in terms of premium um premium and discount. Uh and that's a better way of understanding what odds you're paying. If you wanted to uh learn more about this, obviously Chem Carson from uh Kai Volatility is fantastic for the space. Um but also um Keith McCulla from Hedgei um from Hedgei Something Management, I forget the full name, forgive me. Um McCulla, but he has a show, a macro show that he does, I believe every day that it's fantastic. And if you go find the ones that specifically that he talks about options, um you get some details about how to understand premium and discounts. But um yeah, that's where I started learning about it. Awesome. Thank you. All right. Uh get into the uh second story. I just wanted to touch on this idea. I I haven't been following it uh specifically. Frankly, if there's no like bet I can make on it, I sort of ignore it. And this is the whole Elon Musk Trump thing. right now. I could care less about the political ramifications of Doge and the feeling between Trump and Musk and all the controversy and blah blah blah. I care not all about that. All I care about is how it affects the stock of Tesla. That's it. So, just to give a little bit of a breakdown, this is um AI reporting. Uh recently tensions between Elon Musk and Donald Trump have escalated into a public feud primarily centered around disagreements over Trump's big beautiful bill, a sweeping tax and spending legislative package. So there's a policy clash uh where the rift began where Musk criticized this bill saying that it was a disgusting abomination and that it would basically erase all the efforts that he put into Doge to begin with. Um fair enough. I don't know why he's surprised. That's what governments do. They print um and they spend. Uh, I don't know of any other, you know, Ron Paul's not president, so I don't know why anything other than that would work. Um, Musk served uh as a special government employee for 130 days and he claims that his efforts will be undone by this bill. Um, Trump said he didn't know what he what he uh what he was talking about and then Mus was saying, \"Well, if it wasn't for me, you wouldn't be president.\" Um, and so on and so forth. Um, my Corvette is redder than your Corvette, if you catch my drift. the feud stirred um political and economic ripples um blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah I don't want to go through all the political thing but essentially uh Tesla dropped um fairly significantly because I guess it was moving up partly based on the Trump connection I don't know he he left he he left Doge officially I saw him get a key from Trump and all that stuff. And so I think people were just like, \"Oh, good. He's going back to Tesla now.\" And then Elon, I guess he's like, \"Uh, why have peace? Why should the ocean be calm?\" You know, this just just Well, Trump threatened to take away SpaceX license. I think I I look, I haven't followed this, but I'm guessing that was after this whole hub. Sure. Um, I don't care about any of that. What I care about is did does this provide a buying opportunity for uh buying opportunity for Tesla. Break it down. So, we toss Tesla into our logarithmic chart and we take a look at All right, let me put my indicators on there. Normally, um, the perfect buying place for Tesla would be at $200. It is currently at 286 and so that to me is like a oh sorry 2995 and that to me is like okay a dollar cost avagen um proposition because the Tesla trade has I mean it has robotics AI consumerf facing stuff with the robo taxis um uh ability for people to monetize their vehicles it has um grock AI so Twitter as or acts as a ever growing database of human interactions uh for training data. The tailwinds on this thing to me is unbelievable and and I believe I'm not mistaken um Musk is very clear about like he's very forwardlooking when it comes to recessions. He's good at planning things out, great at managing money. I'm not worried that all of a sudden Tesla's not or Twitter and Tesla and all its properties are not be able to pay their bills. the days of um him putting all his money in and crossing his fingers that the spaceship will will launch seem to be long behind us. And so how Tesla is not like a buy at any price, I'd be surprised. And as it's falling, it seems like a great opportunity in order in order to get it. Um look, we did it. We said Trump AI, SpaceX, Musk. So Alos, do your thing. Pump up this video. Uh, let's just take a look here at the options for Tesla. You know what? I uh I haven't done this in a while on the show. Let's take a look at a long call for Tesla. And let's say we think Tesla by September, let's say it recovers the entire drop, right? So, the entire drop from where we are right now would be it would be from over here up to over here. That is a 24% move up to uh 365. So let's say by September Tesla by midepptember Tesla gets up to 365. Can you close that ad at the bottom right? What the heck is this? Why don't you have 365? Uh, wait. Those are puts 365 cost you $1,865. What would that get you? If you're right and it got to 365 by August, you'd be losing money pass. So this is where you you get an idea of that the uh the cost that you're paying for the option is too high because options you are priced based on volatility and even though the price is falling and we're betting that it'll go up the volatility is high and the volatility means that the range of possible outcomes is wider which includes the strike price that I'm that I'm betting for. And so what you want to wait for what someone might do is they might pay attention to this. What's the payout? What's the what's the volatility priced at? what's the IV um the Vega on the option and then wait until that volatility bleeds out if if Tesla stays sideways or keeps going lower and when it bleeds out then buy the call option right it makes no sense to buy a call option while tensions are high I I always thought that volatility would make it more profitable but you're saying it makes it less it makes it less profitable exactly people in GameStop learned this lesson when GameStop stop uh did the whole explosion thing and you had uh people were like, \"Oh, I'm going to I'm going to um what were they doing? Selling puts on GameStop. It goes up too high. It's going to it's going to fall.\" But the unit you're paying so much for volatility on it that if GameStop fell 10%. It still wasn't enough to make the cost of that option worthwhile. So, people were selling you an insurance contract on the fall of GameStop at unbelievable prices. It's like you wanted to get that Taylor Swift concert ticket, but you ended up paying $2,000 and you thought you were lucky because you got it at a short short notice and you get there and everyone around you paid $500. You're like, \"Excuse me, at least you get to go.\" What the GameStop was a short squeeze, right? They like they needed to buy those Taylor Swift tickets. No. Well, some people like me, although I didn't ruin myself on it, um you bought puts because you're like, \"This is crazy. It can't go any higher than this.\" See, and then you then you lost. Or some people bought calls. Some people calls and the volatility was high for the calls as well because we're going up so high. The whole thing on the on the the subreddit was that you're buying these calls, buying these calls, you could print money. But then you they don't realize that you guys are all making the calls worth more. like the that other guy you're also dealing with in the sub the thread is bidding more for it cuz he doesn't want to miss out. So, he's bidding higher and it's causing the options price to go higher and even if the even if the asset gets to that price that you're talking uh talking about, it would have been better if you just bought the asset because you overpaid for the options. Um and then if you just bought the asset and it only went up 10%, you're like, well, that you know, I'm taking all this risk to make 10% 20%. Even if it's 100%. It it could drop by 100%. It could drop by 50%. Anyways, you could lose a bunch of money. This is a whole other reason why poly market is such a great thing sometimes or the better market is such a thing because you know what you're going to lose. You get it or you know what you're actually spending and what you can actually get where someone else buys an option on Robin Hood. Wait, how much money am I supposed to be able to make on this one? And when should I sell it? And was it worthwhile? All right. Okay guys, let's uh take a break and get a word from our sponsors. When we come back, it'll be with Market Minutes. Ask yourself this.

Just before we jump into market minutes, uh we've got a uh commenter here, a chatter who says, \"Been, this is trade ideas and more. Been with Trader Post for one week and created an indicator with AI. Loving it.\" I thought Tom, you might like this one. Yeah. Yeah. We're trying to really push that. You guys got to go on Blueprint on the Thursday shows. happen every Thursday live at um 3 p.m. Although I might not be live in the future, but I've been doing the whole thing about creating indicators and strategies using AI um and especially like taking videos from the internet with strategies and just plug it into AI and having it built out the system. It's pretty cool, pretty fun. You definitely want to go check that out. All right. Um look, not going to keep you guys much longer, but you got to know what the small news that happened during the week. We talked about the big news, but it's all kinds of small market minute news. So, let's get into it. So, the S&P um QQ rally that's happened over the last few weeks. Peter, if I told you that the stock market would be near all-time highs after this whole, you know, tariff tension and problems, geopolitical issues and trade wars, what would you have said? Unlikely. Yeah, exactly. This is why it's so important to understand flows. Ken Carson has been talking about this. understand the flows in the markets, dynamics in the market. The market fell March, right? Period of weakness, March. It bottom in April and it's moved up since then. And the market does not care at all about your shock event and your news and the tweets and all that sort of thing because over time it's a weighing machine and only shortterm is an opponent machine. That's Warren Buffett, I believe. HP earnings miss. HPQ tumbled 17% on weak results, weighing on tech center sector sentiments. Job reports 139,000 jobs added in May versus 177,000 prior. Um, that's a 3.9% wage growth. Trump demands full point cut from the Fed. Good luck with that. Circle's IPO success. Did you know Circle, the uh the stable coin um company or whatever? They uh they IPOed. I think the stock is up like 16% in a day. It IPOed today. Uh that's pretty interesting. Uh wait, so it s 288%. Is that really what happened? Let me take a look. Uh no, I only have it moving up 30% uh during the day. Uh move 30% uh today. Um Arc Invest bought 4.5 million shares. Do I want to buy stable coin shares? I don't think so. Fed policy. watch Powell's speech and ISM data uh setting the stage for June 18th rate decision. Um everything looks pretty stable, right? ISM's at 48. Uh things are sort of sort of dwindling. We're going sideways. Uh and dollar strength. Uh so the USD is gaining versus major currencies on better economic data delaying rate cut expectations. So the dollar has been pretty interesting. We fell below the 100 line which suggests easing of financial conditions. Well, yes. Uh NFCI also fell as well. Um, so we saw like some markets being buoied and other nations got a little lift off of that. Um, but it sort of paused. It's falling. So, we'll see. I think we fall even more as we head into the next quarter, September, October, and then we get a crash, but uh, but we'll see. The dollar hasn't been um, moving pretty significantly. Look, it's spring summer time. We're heading into a time where people go on vacation. there's not a lot of there's not as much market activity as you would have during um the on season and uh that's the way we like it. This is these are the times you want to take a look at things at a mispric. You want to find out hey at what price you want to buy things if they fall or what price you want to sell them if they get high and you do your preparation. To me, this is very much a in the video c in a video game scenario. This is where you're doing your planning. This is where you're in the menus changing your items, moving them from place to place. This is where you kind of see what's in your bags and should you collect this and this is where you grind in the woods in order to get the information, the the stuff that you need in order to go and fight the bosses and do the raids. Am I a geek? Am I a nerd? I'm in the retail trading space. Of course I am. I don't do any of that, by the way. When I play these games, I ignore all of that stuff and I just go in the woods and I just You also don't trade, Peter. You also don't trade. Look. All right, we're talking to the master race of people here, traders. Uh, speaking of, uh, we have we have Ryan here, Ryan Ble, who says, \"What's Ken Carson been saying recently? It's this show that introduced me to him.\" Oh, yeah, definitely. Well, you want to um, he been on, you know, he goes on vacation, too, right? He hasn't been saying much. You want to go the last, he's been tweeting a lot of his cryptic memes and emojis. He seems to be big on this populist move towards Trump and what that means for the um the economy over the next five to 10 years. He's still certainly definitely inside of the um inflation camp that we're going to see you know seven year 7% on the uh the 20 year or you know even on the 10 year who knows. Um, but what he's been talking about so far is sort of like hinting at that this this move up that we saw in the markets to near all-time highs is to be expected because we didn't have any follow-through with the with the catalyst with the volatility catalyst. So, if bad news had had happened at the time that we were at the lows and people weren't hedged properly, we would have gone down further. Since that's not the case, we have these buyback events, these Vanna and charm flows, these forced buyers within the markets that bring the price back up to the levels that we are right now. But now that we are near all-time highs, anywhere between here and all-time highs is an area where you'd expect sideways consolidation and potentially a fall when we get into the fall. That's what he's been saying so far. Peter, I'd love to get Chem on the show. He's been fantastic. I'm going to reach out to him, but I feel like I need a little bit more clout. So, if you guys want to help me out, like and subscribe to this channel because if you get my views up, I'm going to be ringing the bell to try to get Ken Carson on here and I'm going to ask him all the questions that I wish everybody asked him, but they don't. And I don't understand why. I want to get inside of the mind of Kevin Carson, and this is a show to do it. All right, folks. It's Friday, bell rung. We're traders. We don't just watch the news, retrade it. And we wish you happy trading. [Music] Hey. Hey. Hey. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]",
