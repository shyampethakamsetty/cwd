  "title": "Nintendo Switch 2 “is a huge launch” despite global trade tensions & headwinds.",
  "transcript": "Well, the Nintendo Switch 2 is officially out with lines across the US and the world as gamers head to their nearest retailer to pick up the new console. The first Nintendo Switch launched in 2017. It sold 152 million units. Nintendo expecting to sell 15 million units of the Switch 2 this year despite potential headwinds from global trade tensions. This is a huge launch. I mean, this happens once every 7 to 10 years. The success of the Switch was virtually unprecedented for their home console brands. The console, as you can see, $4.49. That's a big price jump from the $300 of the original. If you get the game uh Mario Kart World with it, it's $4.99. You save a little bit of money there. New JoyCons, uh they're now magnetic. Uh they can also be used as a mouse. They have built-in chat as well as new multiplayer features where you can set up a little camera that's built into a PD piranha plant, that piranha that eats Mario in the games, and you'll be able to communicate with other players.",
