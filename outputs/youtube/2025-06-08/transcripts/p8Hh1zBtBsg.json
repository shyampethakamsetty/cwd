  "title": "Chinaâ€™s rare earth permit delays to disrupt U.S. auto industry",
  "transcript": "China's ongoing restrictions on rare earth minerals have already begun to impact industries reliant on the key materials. China imposed export restrictions, which means that you now had to apply to get a license to be able to export these rare earths. We had a very short supply of these materials here in the United States. Certain auto companies have already run out. We saw Ford actually stop production of the Ford Explorer in Chicago because it hasn't been able to access these materials. There's a frustration right now that China is not issuing out all of the permits fast enough, creating these supply chain disruptions. Our understanding is that about 25% of permits have been approved. And given we are coming from a system where there was no permitting. You put in the order and you got the rare earth.",
