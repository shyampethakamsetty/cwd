  "title": "President Donald Trump's Attack on DEI",
  "transcript": "The term diversity, equity, and inclusion began right after the Civil Rights Act. It regained popularity after the death of George Floyd and is now back in the spotlight after President Trump's crackdown on the initiatives. Now, many say his decisions are dividing the country more than ever. So, help me God. Congratulations, Mr. Following President Trump's inauguration, with a stroke of a pen, he began rolling back efforts on diversity, equity, and inclusion. These are policies that were absolute nonsense throughout the government and the private sector. Signing executive orders to end DEI offices, terminating affirmative action enforcement for federal contractors, and eliminating federal DEI positions across multiple agencies. DEI at HUD is dead. DEI is dead at the VA. DEI is dead at the EPA. The following weeks, the White House clamping down on corporate America to follow suit. Companies including Boeing, Home Depot, Meta, Amazon, Disney, Croup, Bank of America, and Barclays changing their tune. What we removed were specific gender and diversity related targets which we had had for employees. Back in November, Walmart announced its roll back on DEI efforts. But the world's largest retailer kept most initiatives, only making minor changes, like replacing the word diversity in job titles with the word belonging. Some companies did not waver. Costco defending its DEI programs as legal, saying, quote, \"Our commitment to an enterprise rooted in respect and inclusion is appropriate and necessary.\" Target once praised for hitting the bullseye on pro diversity measures, dialing back on his DEI goals, causing a nationwide boycott. The decision contributing to a near 4% decline in the company's first quarter sales, leaving executives disappointed. I want to be clear that we're not satisfied with this performance and we're moving with urgency to navigate through this period of volatility. As the backlash against Target continues, President Trump's crackdown on DEI initiatives has brought lawsuits both on state and federal levels with many calling his decisions on the topic unconstitutional. It'll be certainly one to watch on how the courts decide in the coming weeks and months. In New York, Shaquille Omari, Bloomberg News.",
