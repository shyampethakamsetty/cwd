  "transcript": "your chart analyst here at OptionPit. Be sure to visit us at optionpit.com. This week's chart of the week is Tesla. And what a week Tesla has had. Tesla consolidated back here on the median line in early late April, early May. Had a very nice rally up into the next top channel. held the support there as it consolidated trying to well it got its first leg. Never quite made it to the top there at 389. Instead has collapsed, paused at the pitchfork support, which you can see going across there, which also lines up with the 21-day moving average. Bad news yesterday uh feuding with the president. Um, very large bearish day. Did not quite trade down to the median line, but that's where our major league support is on the median line, 270. Watch for that. Interesting that it popped up right between the 200 and the 50-day, touching both on Friday today. Now, I would wait for a move away from either of those moving averages and ride it back up to 330 or down to 270. This inside day is called a harami candle and harami could possibly be negating this bearishness that occurred on Thursday. We need more evidence and confirmation on Monday. Watch for Tesla to trade beyond the 200 day moving average and you're safe to carry it higher. Thank you for watching. Please like, subscribe, comment, or leave a stock you would like analyzed. I'll see you next week.",
