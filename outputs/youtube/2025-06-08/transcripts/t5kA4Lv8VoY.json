Now, let's get right into today's video. So today I want to talk about four of the biggest stock splits happening here in June. And remember, stock splits could have some potential benefits for investors. So before I get into the list of stocks having stock splits in June, let's quickly go over what some of those potential benefits could be, let's use Google as an example here. So, Google before it had its last stock split, right before it split, was trading at around $2,255 a share. After its stock split, right after it went down to $112 a share. So, let's say you wanted to purchase one share of Google before its stock split. If you didn't have access to fractional shares, you had to have over $2,000 to just buy one share of Google. Now, after its stock split, if you wanted to buy one share of Google, all you had to have was a little bit over $100. So, it could make the stock more accessible to those investors that don't have access to fractional shares and don't have a lot of money. It could also, for example, make trading options more affordable. So again, let's say you wanted to sell cash secured puts on Google before it stock split, you had to have $220,000 to sell cash secured puts. Right after its stock split, when it dropped to $112 a share, you only had to have about $11,000. So a lot less money. Same thing for buying calls, buying puts. You would have to have a lot less money. You needed a lot less money to trade options on Google. So, those could be some of the potential benefits for stock splits. But remember, just because a stock has a stock split does not mean it's a buy. Now, let's get right into the list here today. So, let's start with the first stock on the list. This is going to be ticker symbol RGC. So, let's take a look here at this stock. So, currently at $697 a share, this has a 52- week high of $950. In the last year, this stock is up over 15,000%. And in the last 5 years, this stock is up 5,700%. Looks like it was listed on July 16, 2021. So we can already see this is an extremely volatile stock. So I would proceed with caution if you trade this stock. But let's take a look here first at what this stock does or what the company does. Then we'll take a look at the stock split details. So what does this company do? So let's take a look here. So, Rigiden Cell Bioscience Holdings is an early stage bioscience company that focuses on the research, development, and commercialization of TCM for the treatment of neurocognitive disorders and degeneration, specifically ADHD and ASD and infectious diseases affecting people's immune system. So if you want to learn more about them, definitely go ahead and check out their website. But what are the stock split details for this stock? So let's take a look at that here next. So let's see here. Reg and Cell Bioscience Holdings Limited announces forward stock split. This was June 2nd, so very recently. So they announced that its board of directors approved a 38 for1 forward stock split to be paid in the form of a stock bonus. So remember the way you read this is basically for every share you own for every one share you own you'll have 38 times as many if you hold through the stock split. Right? So if you have one share when you hold to the stock split, after the stock split you would have 38 shares. So you'll get an additional 37 shares for every share you have. This will also affect the share price. So again, one share right now is $697. Let's just pretend that's the same price it is right when the stock split happens. Now, after the stock split happens, that would go down to $18.34. So, you'll have 38 times as many shares, but each share will only be around $18.34 instead of $697. That's how a stock split works. Now, let's take a look here. Each shareholder of the company of record at the close of business on June 12th will receive 37 additional shares for every share held on the record date. The company expects the additional shares will be distributed on June 13th subject to final approval by the NASDAQ capital markets. It looks like it's still waiting for some approval here. Trading is expected to begin on a post stock split adjusted basis at market open on June 16, 2025. The forward stock split is intended to enhance liquidity in the market for the company's ordinary shares and to make the shares more accessible to investors. No action is required by shareholders in connection with the forward stock split. So again, it's a very volatile stock it looks like, but this is the first stock on the list. Again, proceed with caution on this stock. Now, let's move on to the next stock on today's list. The next stock is going to be ticker symbol APG, API Group. So, let's take a look here at this stock. currently at $48.74 with a 52- week high of 48.883. So, it's basically at its 52- week high. In the last year, the stock is up over 30% and in the last 5 years, this stock is up over 328%. This stock does not have a dividend. Now, what does this company do? Let's take a look at that here very quickly. So, API group provides safety and specialty services worldwide. The company offers end to end integrated occupancy systems such as fire protection services, heating, ventilation and air conditioning solutions and entry systems, elevators, escalators and various infrastructure. and specialized industrial plant services as well as a lot more. So again, if you want to learn more about the company, go ahead and check out their website. But what are the stock split details here for the stock? Let's take a look at that here next. So API group expands credit facility announces stock split. So let's take a look here. So API group announced a 342 stock split of its common stock. So again the way you read this is for every two shares you own, you'll now have three shares, right? So if you have two shares you hold through the stock split, you'll have three shares. If you have four shares you hold through the stock split, you'll have six shares after. Again, that means the share price will also drop. So again, one share right now is at around $48 a share. Let's say it's at around that same price when the stock split happens. After the stock split, one share would be at around $32 a share. So, we take a look here. This will be executed through a dividend distribution. Shareholders on record as of June 16 will receive one additional half share for each share they own on June 30. The stock split will not apply to holders of the company series A preferred stock. But after the split, the preferred stock will be convertible into 6 million shares of common stock. This move is expected to increase the liquidity of the shares and make them more accessible to a broader range of investors. The company has stated that cash payments will be issued in lie of any fractional shares resulting from the stock split. So we have the stock split details for this stock. Now, let's go on and move to the next stock on today's list. So, the next stock will be ticker symbol P E G A P System. So, let's take a look here. So, currently at $11 a share. In the last year, the stock is up over 74% with a 52- week high of $113 a share. And we take a look here in the last 5 years this stock is up 6%. This is also a dividend stock.
