  "transcript": "Hey guys, Tyler with Game Edge here. Welcome back to another education piece. Today we're going to be talking about our 100% mechanical trading strategy called Pansrance Plus GAX, which is significantly outperforms the SPY SPX on multiple time frames. Pans of Plus, those are two key levels we use at Gamma Edge based off the options market data and structure of the market and how speculators are positioned. So, we're going to get exactly into all of that good stuff. So, getting straight to it, you know, have you ever had a stock, the setup looked perfect on paper, clean technical setup, solid fundamentals, everything aligned, only to watch it immediately move against you the moment you entered. Or maybe on the flip side, uh something even equally frustrating, a great opportunity hesitated to take the the entry and then it just ripped. If you're not along, if you're not along, you're definitely not alone. Most traders struggle with the same fundamental challenges. emotional driven decisions that sabotage otherwise sound analysis. Fear of beating wrong, the greed to maximize every move, for the paralysis of having too many variables to consider. These psychological hurdles often matter more than your technical skills or market knowledge. But what if there was a way where you could remove emotions altogether? Not only that, but a way of identifying high probability setups, entry and exit at predetermined levels and letting the own and letting the market's own structural forces work in your favor. All without having to, you know, second guess yourself or fight your instincts. This is exactly what our P transit plus mechanical trading strate trading strategy delivers. And just for some quick statistics for you, over the past 12 years, this systematic approach has generated over,300% total return compared to SPY's 400% return. That's nearly a 3.4x over simply buying and holding the market. And this strategy is very simple to implement. This isn't about chasing hot stocks or timing perfect entries. It's about understanding how options market structure creates predictable price movements and positioning yourself to benefit from those patterns consistently trade after trade. In fact, we've c we've curated a list of large cap quality stocks driven by options market which we include in our universe of selectable stocks for this strategy. This is called the gamma edge liquidity list. So think Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Meta. There's no little crappy meme stocks, right? It's these high quality names. So, in this lesson, you're going to discover the complete back tested performance across multiple multiple market cycles. The surprisingly simple entry and exit rules. How to implement this strategy in just minutes each day. Why removing discretion actually improves performance and how our live portfolio has validated the back testing in real time. So, right, just getting to it. showing you this this cumulative performance. Again, here's the 1300% versus the 400%. And now, let's get to the specific back testing results. And so, before diving into how the strategy works, let's address the elephant in the room, right? Like, does the strategy actually deliver on what we're claiming? Short answer is yes. And the numbers are equally impressive when you see the strategy broken down across multiple uh different market environments. And just quick before we get going, you know, special shout out to our partner at Edge Raider. Very sophisticated system that allows us to upload our data and perform this this back testing. Before we get going any further, yes, we have back testing over multiple periods, but we also have forward testing live since July of 2023 that validate these back testing results that we will get to at the bottom and you'll be able to have access to all those trades. Right? So here the first back testing is uh 12-ear track record from Jan of 2013 to May of 2025 Jan of 13 because that's when our data starts but there's plenty of market cycles in between those two periods right same total returns we've already hit on this multiple times now 76% win rate almost 1,800 trades uh average trade win was $800 and you know draw down of 29% versus spy of 33%. So the TLDDR of this is you experienced less downside risk by gener gener gen generating nearly 10x the absolute returns. This consistently outperformed through the you know 2015 taper tantrum 2018 correction 2020 COVID crash and 2022 bare market. And if you guys want to you guys can stop and pause the YouTube video. You can look at all these stats. This is the spy here. This is the P transit plus strategy here. And then the the the equity curves down here which just shows the the significant outperformance. Next uh time period is June 2020 to May of 2025. So 5-year period there. Again uh our strategy almost double more than doubled the performance of the spy, right? And again this is through different market regimes, right? And what what's compelling here is how our strategy maintains its edge through dramatic through dramatically different market regimes. 2021 everything bubble uh end of 2022 bare market and then the recent AI rally right and again feel free to review this in depth. It kind of has all your standard ratios that people look that uh people look at to measure the quality of systems. And then here we have the equity curves again for the for the um for the two systems. And then lastly we just have a year a year to date May 25, right? And so here we're looking at P transfer plus X 11% with 11% draw down and SPY is up less than 1% with a 19% draw down. So you know if you're just buy and hold investor you could have endured you know 19% draw down while basically breaking even or you know our strategy has captured you you'd be up 11% through the end of May with half the downside risk. And just quickly hitting on the the stats of our strategy 83% win rate over 48 trades. You know, you can see the annualized return almost 27% sharp ratio 1.25. So, very impressive strategy. Again, if you want to look at the stats, feel free to pause the video, check those out. All good. Here's the uh equity equity curve of those as well, right? And something I hit on earlier, but wait, you know, isn't this just back back testing? Yes, but since June of 23, we've been running this portfolio live in our Discord community, posting every entry and exit signal. No cherry-picking, no hindsight adjustments, no theoretical performance. And uh the thing to note is that the and the forward testing has matched the back testing. Every trade is documentedly publicly tracked in a shared Excel spread Excel spreadsheet and discussed openly with our community. You can see exactly how the strategy performs where real money's on the line complete with the occasional losing trade. Yeah, believe it or not, we post losing trades and draw down periods, right? And you know, this isn't just a hypothetical system, you know, it's a strategy that we ourselves share transparently with the community. The strategy works because it's based off structural forces in the options market that create predictable price movements. When those forces align with our entry criteria, we participate. When they don't, we wait. Simple, systematic, profitable. Bottom line, you know, if you would have invested in January of 2013 with a 100 grand, it' be worth 1.45 million today using the strategy and, you know, really only half a million using spy. Then we we will put this link in the description or if you're reading the newsletter, we're going to have a link live in there as well. Uh, and then here is our output from uh this is from 5225. Again, first trade was at the beginning of uh July. Sorry, I know we said we started at June, July. It was July here. You know, we've seen we've 290 trades, 71% win rate, um, you know, positive expectancy overall on those trades. So, yeah, I mean, it's performing exactly how we wanted to. And just looking at the duration, you know, the the average winning trade a little over a month, average losing trade a little over two months. So, now let's get into the strategy background and the core the the core concept of it. Now that you have an understanding of its performances, we need to show you about how easy it is to implement this. So the strategy utilizes two of the key levels that we've developed at GAM edge that's derived straight from the options market structure, right? We're not making anything up. No complex algorithm. We're literally just looking at speculation and um identifying our key levels from there. So PRA, this is the first level. This is our entry point. Uh this is where call speculators start to take control of the option structure. So once that happens, we generally see a bullish foundation and this is where we start to see a we expect to see an acceleration higher in spot price up to uh what what is called plusex or px which this is the highest concentration of call gamma in a particular strike in the structure which is our profit target cuz right when a strike the largest strike with the most amount of call gamma this is the largest positioning on a short-term basis. So this is kind of a natural monetization point if we're if we're able to get up to that point. So that's why it makes sense for it to be a profit target. And in a strong stock, what we expect is when we take the entry, ideally we want P trends to keep moving higher and higher and higher as speculators are committing capital higher and higher and higher. That's where you where you get those runners. But if not, then we we we hit the the plus target. It takes us takes us out out of the trade, especially in stocks where we're not seeing that that continued speculation higher. So, that's kind of a great um built-in feature of the strategy. The core insight of the strategy is that in today's markets, options often drive stock price. When traders buy calls at the current stock price, market makers hedge by buying stock. As price rises towards those strikes, hedging pressure intensifies, creating a feedback loop that accelerates price movements. That's just what I hit on earlier. Our strategy identifies where those structural setups are in place and positions us to benefit from the resulting acceleration and feedback loop. So again just hitting on the importance of these levels. Pren was constructed to identify the threshold where the market structure is dominated by calls. This implies that at this strike and all prices above the market expects that price to continue to rise. As price extends higher, dealers face increasing directional risk from their short calls i.e. Traders are long alam money calls compelling them to hedge by buying more shares. This action further drives price up and our strategy aims to capitalize on this dealer induced buying pressure exploiting the market dynamics for potential upside gains. This doesn't even hit on the fact too that when price is rapid is rapidly moving higher we get FOMO from their retail traders as well piling into more alimony calls which just intensifies that feedback loop that we just discussed. Right. All right. And then plus is the natural upside target for this strategy as this is the most convex call strike in the uh complex. In layman's terms, we see the most short-term expert speculation at this strike. Once this level is reached, those call speculators have seen a significant appreciation in their options contracts. Right? As an example, say spot price is at 80 plus GEX is at 100. So when they put that bet on, they put on $20 of out of the money risk. Once the price goes up to 100, they've captured that full $20 and those contracts are worth significantly more money. So they're going to want to lock in those profits, right? And again, by by convexity, what we mean is that this is the maximum point um of convexity. Again, I just repeated myself, but meaning the kind of rate of change of their options contracts. Once the convexity um starts to go down that means that that their contract while the price could be appreciating their contract value is not um moving at uh an accelerated pace that that it's actually going lower. So in other words when when plus has been reached the the the juice has been squeezed from their position. Getting into the rules right it's very simple and everything happens on end of day data. So overnight you're going to know the exact positions that you're going to be in entering on market open the the following session. So for an entry the stock needs to start the current session below P trans and close the current session above PRA. If that happens then entry will be on the market open for the next session. Right? And then exit is simply that the stock closes the the current session above PX. If it closes above PEX above PX, then on entry at market open on on the next day, you are going to be exiting that trade. Our position sizing, we recommend, you know, four to 7%. Well, it's not a recommendation. That's just what we found to be most successful. In our live portfolio, we use 7% 7% positions. We understand folks are not comfortable putting you know that much capital into one single position but again that's what the back testing is and if you deviate from the back testing then you should not expect to replicate those um those um stats and again just a disclaimer you know past performance is not guaranteed future success all that good stuff you know ultimately you're responsible for your for your for you know entering exit trades but again this is a very good strategy as opposed to just buying and holding spy right Then stop loss. There is no stop-loss. Why? Because back testing has shown that stop-lossing hurts performance. But you know the despite the lack of a formal stop-loss, there is an exit rule built into the strategy which we just discussed above which is you know closing above PX. When stocks decline rapidly, PX is going to also decline as well. So there is a built-in stop-loss per se in the strategy. This is not to say that you will not take heat in the strategy, i.e. experience a draw down because you will and we showed with back testing. We're very transparent that yes, you could experience a draw down. However, as with any strategy, you must stay the course and follow the rules. Position sizing is key for this strategy. So, pay attention to this as you review the back testing results. Getting to why mechanical uh execution matters. Discretion usually hurts performance. When you start second guessing yourself, you know this one looks risky or let me wait for better entry. You introduce the emotion that this system eliminates the beauty. Did it just close above Patrans after starting below? Yes. Okay. Enter. Did it close above Patrans? Yes. Exit. Everything else is just noise. And then for for finding those those candidates for pans uh within the Discord community, we have specific proprietary scans that find these candidates for us, right? We have a p trans plus x scan that you can just use in our discord. It'll produce uh let me turn on the annotation. So right here is the command and it produces the these outputs with these are the tickers. Uh the thing to keep in mind is this uses end of day data. So our data processing generally occurs after 5:45 Eastern Standard Time. So that is the best time to be running it is sometime. Um but we we we also automatically post this list in Discord too. So if you don't get a chance to run it, chances are someone else have. So it should be no worries. And we also too communicate this, you know, either pre-market or the night before what we're doing personally for for the entry and exits of of the petrants for for that live portfolio we we discussed. And then same thing for the exit candidates. We've created another scan again close above PX very self-explanatory. and it shows you those tickers that are closing above PFX. And like I said in the Discord, we have a specific channel, P2P Management, where we're posting are the the official entries and exits for the strategy. So, right, getting into your daily workflow if you're interested in implementing the strategy after the market closes, you know, around 6:00 after dinner, check the P2P management channel where we post those scan results so you know what the new entries and exits are for the session tomorrow. When the market opens, you execute on those entries. That's it. you know, no intraday monitoring, no second guessing, no emotional trading during market hours. It literally could take you 5 minutes if you're interested in doing this. Yes, I know this is not a super sexy strategy, right? But it works. Why does it work? Because it's based off the mechanics of how modern markets work today. And right, final thoughts. By now, you've seen the performance data and understand the mechanics of the strategy. The question now isn't whether it works, it's whether you're ready to execute it consistently. The system only works if you follow it exactly. That's with anything in life. If you're following a system, you need to follow it to a te. If you deviate, then you should expect to deviate from what the past results have been by following it exactly right. It's taking every signal, every exit, position size consistently, and trust process during losing streaks. Right. Um, this video is recorded on June 7, 2025. And during, you know, the the turmoil that that we've seen at the beginning of 2025, like we certainly incurred a draw down, but we showed those back testing results earlier. Um, let me just go up to it real quick. This right here. Yeah, like we we certainly experienced draw down, not as much as the spy and then we've experienced and participated with that rebound back up. So, you just have to trust the process, trust the system, right? Again, our back testing 12 years of data taken in basically any kind of market condition other than like the great depression. So, basically all that we do is we execute and we let the probabilities work out in our favor. Right? Lastly, the strategy works. Tools are ready. Track it live in Discord. Only variable left is your execution. So, with that, we appreciate your time. Hopefully, this makes sense. If you have any questions, feel free to discuss in the Discord. We have no problem sending you every trade as part of our back testing. We're very transparent, let you guys give it a look. Um, if you want to slice the date up, any any other cuts, any other specific time periods, we're happy to do that as well. So, with that, um, appreciate your time. Thank you. Bye.",
