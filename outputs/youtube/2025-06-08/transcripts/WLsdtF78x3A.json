  "transcript": "[Music] In today's episode, I'm going to talk about how to make money in the market. Now, it doesn't matter if you're interested in Forex, futures, cryptocurrency, or you're interested in trading large cap stocks like Netflix, Google, Apple, Tesla, Nvidia, or you're interested in small cap stocks or even penny stocks. There are people who trade each of these markets who make money, and there are people trading each of these markets who lose money. So, what does it take to become a winning trader? What does it take to extract profit from the market consistently? That's the real question that I'm going to answer in today's episode. My name is Ross Cameron. I'm a full-time trader and I funded my first account back in 2001, more than 20 years ago. So, I've traded in a lot of different markets, bare markets, bull markets, and I've traded a lot of different financial instruments over the years, and I found my niche. Now, I'm also the author of a book titled How to Day Trade: The Plain Truth. And in this book, I break down my strategy and the system that I follow in detail. What I want to do today is start by breaking down the three steps that you need to follow in order to become a trader. Step one, you have to decide on which market you want to trade. You don't want to try to trade all the markets at the same time. And I've seen traders do this. They'll trade forex, they'll trade cryptocurrency, they'll trade futures, they'll trade large caps, penny stocks. They're doing a little bit of everything. The problem is it's not reasonable to expect that you could be good at all of these markets. In fact, we know that being good even at just one market is quite difficult. So really, it's best to focus on one market where you feel like it resonates with you. Now, let me walk you through what my process was on deciding to trade stocks because that's what I got interested in when I first started trading. So, for me, I was in a place where I understood the stock market. I had had friends that had made money in the stock market and so it was just what was natural to me. Now I know a lot of traders who were from Chicago where they learned about the futures market which had its headquarters or its uh exchange in Chicago. So a lot of people out in the Midwest were more familiar with futures trading commodities including some of the different agricultural products you know corn soybean things like that. So is some of your natural inclination towards one market or another maybe based on regionally where you're located. If you're in Europe, you're in uh different parts of Asia, you may be more inclined towards the cryptocurrency markets or perhaps the forex market because a lot of smaller countries don't have their own local stock market that you can trade actively. And so if you're from a smaller country, you may not think that it makes sense or is practical to trade the US stock market from, you know, 3,000 miles away. Now, people do it every day, but it may not be the first thing that you think of. So, what I've noticed about a lot of international traders is that they're more interested in the forex markets. Now, forex markets are a 24-hour market. So, it doesn't matter what time zone you're in or where you're located, you could trade them. Of course, cryptocurrency is also a 24-hour market. and futures trading is a 24-hour market. Now, the stock market is becoming a 24-hour market. So, ultimately, you really could probably choose any market based on it being 24hour and more or less you could trade it from wherever you're located. So, I I think the question for you is going to come down to risk tolerance. Okay. So, when it comes to the cryptocurrency markets, I don't think I'm speaking out of turn when I say that they can be very risky. These are the types of markets where I I mean God is it's insane. But I've seen people put $100 into a a cryptocoin, one of these um essentially very obscure coins, not one of the big coins like Bitcoin or Ripple or Ethereum, but one of these small altcoins. They'll put in $100 and they'll pull out, you know, $5,000 a couple weeks later. The growth can be insane, but these can drop just as fast. And I've seen people lose everything in crypto coins and different currencies. So that's something that you have to be aware of. I I think for traders that have very small accounts, cryptocurrency can be appealing because of that big rate of return that you can get. But I kind of think of it almost as a lottery ticket. And you know, while if you play the lottery every day, you're going to win occasionally, more often than not, people spend and lose far more than they make. So, it's the chase of getting that quick win, but it's not really built around a strategy or a formula for actually replicating that success. A lot of the success I've seen in the crypto markets is, to be honest, based on luck. And I don't think you can depend on luck to pay your rent or to potentially pay a mortgage or to put you through school. You know, it's nice to have a little luck every now and then. certainly better than than the opposite of having bad luck, but you can't depend on that for your career. So, if you've got a really small account, while cryptocurrencies can be appealing, for most traders who have a little bit more money and who have worked hard to save that money, the thought of losing all of it in one trade or because an exchange that you put your money into disappeared overnight is very scary. And so traders with a little bit more money are going to tend to be attracted to the the larger, better regulated and better in insured brokers or exchanges where you can deposit your money and you can rest assured it's not going to disappear overnight. And so that's going to bring you into trading probably not as much cryptocurrency, but perhaps forex, futures, or even stock. Now, one of the things I can tell you about both forex and futures, is that the underlying instrument doesn't usually move all that much. So, when you're looking at a a forex pair, which is a currency pair of the US dollar to the euro, for instance, the the exchange rate doesn't really adjust or move that much on a daily basis. In fact, it moves a very small amount. So, how do you make money trading that? You use extremely large positions utilizing what's called leverage. So, if we jump onto the whiteboard, the way leverage works is if you put in, let's say, $1,000 into an account and you get 100 times leverage, you could buy $100,000 of that underlying currency. And if that currency moves up or down, even just 1%, you could make or lose a,000 bucks, right? So, all of a sudden, you know, you have the potential to make money, but it's only when you use a lot of leverage. And the downside here is that clearly if in the middle of you taking a trade, you just happen to have the misfortune that some crazy international event takes place, you could see a big swing in currencies. They're unpredictable. They don't typically happen, but they can happen. And if they do, and you're in on a 100 times leverage, you're blown out. And so this is what I see happen a lot in the currency markets is traders will trade on high amounts of leverage which is essentially trading on borrowed money. So $1,000 is yours and the remaining $99,000 is the broker's money. And because these markets are very liquid, as soon as the position drops and your $1,000 is gone, they sell. They get their money back, but your money is gone. So, I've seen a lot of cryptocurrenc uh currency traders trading these markets on leverage and ending up blowing up their entire account. And I've seen the same thing happen in the futures market. So, the the price uh of a lot of these commodities, the futures commodities, whether it's gold or um or or commodities like soybeans or corn or coffee, they fluctuate, but not so much that you can make a lot of money day trading them unless you utilize leverage. And again, the use of leverage poses the same risk. So, what I ended up focusing on in my own trading was trading stocks. So, let me give you an example here of a typical trade that I might take on a stock. So, we have a stock that's moving up. Let's say it's at $3 a share and I buy 1,000 shares. So, that equals a $3,000 position. And my goal on this is that the stock goes up 10%. So, the $3.30. I then sell the,000 shares for 330 300, sorry, $3,300 and I pocket a profit of 300 bucks. So that's a 10% return. And if I can get a trade like that and I don't have to take a lot of trades like this, but I could do a couple trades like this each day, then all of a sudden on a good day, my account could be up 20 30%. And here's the thing that I like about this type of strategy. By trading lowerric stocks, I don't have to put a lot of money into the position, but they still can be volatile enough to go up or down 50%, maybe 75% even 100% in one day. So, I'll show you just a couple of examples of exactly this. So, let's see. Um, ICCT. So, this just is just as an example, a stock today that's up 156%. It's got 145 million shares of volume. You can see all the volume right there. So, as this stock went from $2 to three to four to five to six, you didn't need to take very many trades on this to potentially grow your account by 10% in one day. In fact, just one or two very carefully timed and executed trades would have been enough to have a terrific day on a stock like this. APVO, this is another stock that was on uh watch this morning. This one was very volatile. Room to the upside and also the downside. OSR. This is a stock right here just later in the morning that went from a$180 all the way up to 320. And so in the stock market, we see moves like this pretty much every single day. Now, you do see moves similarly in terms of percentages in the crypto markets, but as I said, if you're going to trade the crypto markets, you well, generally, if you're going to get that kind of return, you have to trade the altcoins. and you can only buy them with another cryptocurrency, which means you need to put your money into Bitcoin or into Ethereum or one of these other cryptocurrencies and then use that to then purchase this altcoin. So, you're like double in the market because then if the main coin that you're in goes down and then also your altcoin goes down, then you're at a double loss. And so, for me, I just felt certainly much more comfortable trading stocks. Now, I started trading before cryptocurrencies were even around. So, it was natural that that wasn't even, you know, a choice for me when I got started. But even today, I feel much more comfortable trading in the stock market than in the crypto market. However, the choice is yours with which market you decide to go towards. And it's going to be based on probably your risk tolerance, your account size, perhaps where you're located, your time zone, and so on and so forth. So, step one is choosing the market that you want to trade. and just choose one market. Focus on getting really good at it before venturing out into a second market. Step two. All right. So, if the first step is choosing the market, the second step is developing your system. You don't make money in the market unless you're approaching the market with consistency. So, this is one of the really important things. What separates the winners from the losers? The winners treat trading like a business. Trading and investing, it's like a business. And so you have essentially a modified business plan which is your strategy. The strategy dictates when you would buy, what exactly what you look for before you buy. So if we just look at a chart like this for instance, you might look at this and think, oh well geez, this thing went up quite a lot. And it did, but where precisely would you buy? Of course, if you bought right here, you know, you'd be in at the top and then it's selling off. um you know if you bought down here maybe you would have done well but then you would have missed this move later. So having a strategy means that you actually have a set of rules that are going to dictate what you're going to buy, what instrument, whether it's a stock or cryptocurrency or forex pair, futures, whatever it is you're what you're going to buy, typically the time of day that you're going to trade because you want to take all your trades around the same time of day each day. That way you can base your metric metrics and success around this is the time of day I trade and this is how I perform during that window. Personally, I have found that I make a lot more money trading in the morning than in the afternoon. That's on Eastern Standard Time. But that's a trend that I found in my own trading. So, if I was trading kind of half-hazardly all throughout the day when I had a couple minutes, I think I would it would be hard for me to understand if if I was inconsistent, if that was the result of just different times a day or if it was the result of my own strategy. So approaching trading like a business means having a fairly strict set of rules that dictate what you buy, what time of day you buy, where you get in, and where you get out. So you need to understand buy signals, and you need to be able to understand sell signals. This is very important, and that is ultimately what's going to give you your edge. Now, I've known a lot of traders out there that try to use a different combination of maybe uh indicators and alerts and things like that and and those are all well and great, but they're only useful if you apply them consistently, right? If you don't use it all the time, then how do you know it really works? You know, maybe it didn't work or or it it it works when you use it, but then all the times you don't use it, you lose. And so it's like if you're not tracking in quite a bit of detail each one of your trades, then you won't know what you can do to improve. So as part of step two, treating trading like a business, it's very important that you document every single trade you take with the details of how well it fit within your strategy plus any additional notes that you can add. This is essentially you creating historical data and and a lot of people will talk about back testing a strategy. So if you sat down and you said, \"Well, all right, I'm going to I'm going to just come up with a strategy right now. I'm going to trade when you know,\" and you sort of come up with like a set of rules. How do you know if that would work? So there are systems that you can run that would back test how that set of rules performed on a set of historical data. So when you run a back test, you get to see if I done all of that during the last 90 days, would I have made money? And sometimes the answer will say yes, and sometimes it'll say no. But in the case it says yes, some people will say, \"Well, geez, I'm just going to run this strategy now moving forward because now I know 100% certainty it's profitable.\" But here's the really interesting thing about back testing. When you have a set of data from the last 90 days, you could sort of reverse solve to create a strategy that would trade that data set profitably, but that's not a guarantee that you'll have the same set of data moving forward because the markets are always changing. And so people can get an artificial sense of confidence with historical data wi with essentially back a back testing. They think my back test is good, so therefore I'll be profitable. And so what I instead encourage people to do is to trade every single day or as often as you're able to and to track all of your trades with real money so you can maintain your own set of historical data, not based on your strategy matching a particular data set, but based on your own trades. And then from your own winners and your own losers, you look at the relationship of what is the pattern here? Because that's something that traders become really good at is recognizing patterns. Certainly in the market for instance there's a pattern that um when the price of oil goes up airline stocks go down and when oil goes down airlines go up. They have an inverse relationship because the cost of oil is going to affect the profitability of these airline companies. So you start to recognize these patterns in the market. Typically during recessionary times what types of stocks go up? Dollar General, Walmart, McDonald's, right? So you you realize that there's a pattern and the better you get at recognizing those patterns in the market, the more money you'll make. Now, you don't have to be, you know, a genius and the only person who sees it. You just have to be early enough to see the pattern to be able to capture a little bit of profitability from the volatility that it creates. And that's something that I really want you to think about. Success in trading is not about taking a trade on everything that's moving. It's just about pulling a little bit of profit out of the market each day. And even if you only pulled $100 out of the market with one trade, but you were able to do that consistently over the period of 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 9 weeks, 12 weeks, next thing you know, you're going to think, well, geez, the only difference between pulling out a 100 a day and pulling out 200 a day is increasing my position size. And the only difference between 200 and 400, increasing share size. And next thing you know, you get to the level, well, where I'm at right now, where my hot market daily goal is $20,000 per day. Going back, I start at $200 a day. So, from 200 a day all the way up to $20,000 a day. Now, for me, the best day I ever had, just under half a million dollar in trading profits. By the way, my name is Ross Cameron, and let me be the first to tell you that my results are not typical. I have been doing this for a long time. I'm the author of this book right here, How to Day Trade: The Plain Truth. I teach classes on day trading strategies specifically in the stock market. That's my niche. Everyone kind of finds their niche. And sometimes people say, \"Ross, you know, you're so good at trading stocks. Why don't you trade forex or futures or crypto or whatever?\" And as I said at the beginning of this episode, it's not reasonable to expect that you can be good at everything at once. You find what you're That's like saying Michael Jordan, you know, you were so great at basketball, why couldn't you be really good at um golf and baseball? And he tried. and he wasn't thought he was bad at those, but you can't expect to be an all-star in every single sport you play. Just like trading, it really is very similar. And this is also a performance sport. If you perform well, you do well. And if you if you don't, then then you you struggle. So, it really comes down to you and your ability to follow the rules of the system that you have. Now, I'm a big advocate of not trying to reinvent the wheel and instead learning a system or a strategy that is currently being traded profitably by other traders. So, for those of you guys watching this episode, I will put a link and I'll pin it to the top comments where you can download my small account worksheet which is going to break down my small account trading strategy for you. If you want to start trading it in your own trading today, you're welcome to do that. I would always encourage you to practice in a simulator as you're getting started. No matter what market you're trading and what strategy you're trading, by practicing in a simulator, you're going to be trading real time, but the gains and losses are pretend money. And the important thing here is you'll make beginner mistakes as you're getting started. Everybody does, including me. But the good news is you're not losing hard-earned money. So, you don't put real money on the line until you've first gotten over that, you know, initial kind of learning curve, the initial hurdle of how to buy, how to sell, and kind of how to execute your trades. All right, so step one, step one was choosing your market. You had to choose your market. Step two is choosing a strategy uh or a you could also call it a system. And generally speaking, you're going to want to focus on a strategy or a system that is currently being traded profitably by other traders. Now, step three is you've got to learn the tech the technicals. I'll just say tech for short. So, what are the technicals? Well, when it comes to trading, there are certain things that you'll need to understand. So, for instance, you see my whole trading station here. I've got a lot of charts. I've got a lot of monitors. I've got my broker platform where I'm actually executing the orders. So, in order to trade, you need to know how to fund an account. Now, of course, you use a simulator first, but eventually you'll need to know how to open an account. You'll certainly need to know how to press the buy and sell button, the different types of orders that you can use, because there's a number of different orders you can use in different markets, the times of day that are best to trade, certainly how to find the instruments that are actually moving, whether it's currency pairs, it's a cryptocurrency, it's a futures contract, or it's a stock. How do you find things that are actually volatile? because we don't make money buying and selling something at the same price. We want to buy something and have it go up and then take profit. So for me, I look for things that are already moving. This is a very popular wellestablished strategy that works in pretty much every market. You find momentum and you jump on that momentum. So what you'll know certainly is that generally speaking, we of course we don't make money when things are going sideways. We make money when things are going up. But things don't go straight up. when they get momentum, they have these little waves where they go up. And so, you'll never time, you'll never get in on the first wave because you typically won't know that a stock is about to move because you don't know when a company's going to come out with breaking news. If you did, well, look, you can know when a company's going to report earnings, for instance, but you don't know if the earnings are going to be good or bad. So, it's always a gamble to trade in advance of earnings. So, generally speaking, uh you wait for the news to come out. You wait for something to start moving and then you're essentially now watching it and waiting for the first little pullback here to jump on this momentum and then to ride at the next leg up. And so, this is one of these patterns that we recognize in the market. But in order to find things that are moving in real time, you need to use certain software. That software is going to scan the entire market looking for volatility, which is fairly easy to do. But you need to know how to read those scanners, how to identify what on the scanner is a viable candidate for step two, your strategy, your system, and what you should ignore. Now, of course, another thing that you're going to need to know is how to read breaking news. So, news catalysts come out all the time, and these can affect uh certainly the financial markets in a really big way. You've got economic data. You've got global trade politics that affect um the price of the markets. And then of course you have very specific catalysts that can affect the price of an individual well really anything commodity, cryptocurrency, futures, uh forex pair or a specific stock. So being able to understand how to read news is very important. Understanding the type of instruments are more likely to make big moves. One of the things that you'll come to learn is that movement in the market is the result of an imbalance between supply and demand. It sort of goes back to that very simple uh equation. When you have a tremendous amount of demand for something, whatever it is, then as long as there's a limited level of supply, the price will increase. But something that's interesting is that certain cryptocurrencies have a huge amount of supply, whereas others are very, very limited. And this is true really with all markets. So the lower the level of supply then with the same amount of demand the bigger the imbalance and the bigger the rate of change. So you actually get to a point where you can become very good at predicting the type of instrument that could potentially go up 100 200 300% or more in a matter of not just days but potentially even hours. So once you understand the profile of the type of instrument that makes big moves, you know exactly what to look for. Like anything else, learning the technicals of how to trade requires kind of getting hands-on. And so either setting up your first account in a simulator using your phone where you can actually practice taking a few trades is going to force you to learn some of these various components of trading. Now, if you're serious about learning how to trade, one of the next things that I would encourage you to learn is how to read charts. Because charts, that's what you're looking at right here. This is a chart and it's very specific type of chart called a candlestick chart. But I would encourage you to learn how to read charts because one of your biggest advantages will be your ability to see buy and sell signals right here on these charts. I see them plain as day. I've been reading charts for more than 20 years. So I know how to read charts. I know what I'm looking for. I know what I see. And a lot of beginner traders, their eye is not yet trained to see those buy and sell signals on the chart. And the result is that you end up buying and selling at the exact wrong places and therefore losing money. So what is it that the winners, the people who make money consistently in the market, what are they doing differently? They're approaching trading with a system, with a strategy, with a set of rules. They know exactly which market to trade, and they know their technicals. They know how to read the charts. They know how to read the scanners. And so all of that gives them an edge, but a lot of that, those are all learned behaviors. These are things that they learn through studying. So if you want to continue learning, I'm going to put a link to an episode right here on how to read candlestick charts, which I think you guys will really enjoy. And I'll put another episode right here, which is a deep dive on technical analysis. So let's continue learning. And hey, if you haven't already downloaded my small account strategy worksheet, make sure you download that.
