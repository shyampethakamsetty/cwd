  "transcript": "Friday. Welcome back. Uh Chris Paul here. Final hour session, 3 p.m. Eastern time, June 6th. We're live. I just had a webinar run a little bit long. Sorry for the late start. Uh but overall markets kind of just doing their chopfest. Uh these blue lines represent the daily profit play this morning. So we took profit already. Uh ended up getting out for profit target was let's see the math here 30. So 30 out of 55. end up going for a 55% winner on both of the the daily profit plays today. I'll take that all day every day. Um, you know, it's probably looking good to hang on to it for the rest of the day if you want to, but that's uh never my priority. Uh, so that high, that low, and uh price did what we needed to do today for a nice little winner. Uh, I closed out pretty early. Trying to think when I updated this in my Telegram channel. Uh, let me take a look here at daily profit play. closed out around 11:25 a.m. uh closing down for a 25cent debit. So, uh not too bad. For Friday, we actually went 10 for 10 this week on Daily Profit Play. Went uh four for five this week on double ups. Um I didn't chase earnings. We had Broadcom this week, which is AVGO. And uh they did uh they had positive earnings, but the market didn't really uh do much. I mean, the move was I I think the market was expecting maybe a $26 move and it only moved about $13. So, had we dump jumped into like a a a directional chasing trade, that would have probably worked out not in our favor. And uh we probably also would have gotten enough uh sell premium to cover a $13 move. So, I'm glad we stayed out of that one. Uh the one trade that could have paid pretty well would have been a very option sensitive Lululemon. Uh, and we went from 3 330 down to 265. I ended up taking a trade this morning on Lululemon with a 160 by 155. Put in a ratio spread. Uh, I posted that for my project options edge group. Uh, if you're interested in taking that trade, uh, there's still about a 94 to 95% chance of profit on that ratio spread. Uh, it's worth about 200 bucks. And, um, also there's a profit trap. I can potentially get another 500 bucks out of that trade if price is going to drop 70% from the all-time highs. So, if we have some resilience here at these lows, I think we're in some pretty good shape. Um, anyway, it is what it is. So, uh, let's see some comments, questions. What do you want to take a look at? Kevin, what's happening? Happy Friday. Uh, top of the hour pinch point scanner. I'm going to have another master class today. Um, I didn't get a chance, and I'll do this on Monday. I didn't get a chance to price out my trades like I wanted to yesterday. So, uh, tickers CE, DOL, ATA, PLTR, that's Palanteer, household name, RKT, Nike, and Delta. Um, I don't think they've made like a big crazy run today, but let's have a look at them. So, CE, this is all from my pinch point scanner yesterday. Yeah, I mean, nothing crazy in this one. This is still a valid trade going into Monday. Uh, Dol, another one. Uh, we started to get some directional move. I was looking at a very inexpensive uh bare bare put spread. Uh, it's still going to be like a $250 risk, but it could pay up like $600 or $700 in profit if this thing does in fact go lower. Fundamentally, it's it's due for a a pullback. I'm sorry. Fundamentally, like longer term, it's like higher levels, but I think technically after this rip from 270 up to 540, it's like literally this thing's up 100%. Like what? Dolingo is outperforming Broadcom. Dualingo is outperforming Palanteer. like who knew that uh it was so profitable to learn a second language. So anyway, um but if it has a pullback then it was a pretty cheap way to trade that. So that was one. It still it still hasn't moved away from us yet. Um AZTA, this one again, you know, pretty choppy. It popped up on my scanner yesterday, so this is still a good one to price out for next week. Uh Palunteer, we're right back in the middle. So, actually, you know, now that I see this, I feel like Palanteer is giving us uh maybe a good looking uh I mean, that's the whole point of my pinchoint scanner is can we find some indecision? And because we had a down day yesterday, up again today, uh is this going just to stay sideways? So, maybe the best thing is let's let uh Palanteer potentially get into like a go filter on my pinch point scanner. And if that is the case, then there's there's a trade coming. Um, so I I might just let this marinate a little bit longer. Uh, RKT, this one also hasn't gone anywhere. So, we we've got some potential move. I might go a little bit further out in this one. I was looking at December, uh, because I want to see if we start to get to the rate cut cycle from the Fed. We we probably have to see some rate cuts in order to see something as housing market related go higher. Uh, Nike is at 62. I only wanted to be bullish on this one. Uh Nike, I was looking at a uh credit spread. Oh, that's right. Okay, that actually this is a really good trade. I'm going to take this trade right now. So, my Pinch Point scanner, I think I posted this one yesterday. Let me have a look here. Nike. Nike. I didn't. Okay, so we have earnings on the 26. I'm going out to August 15th and I'm going to do a 55 by 50 and I'm looking to get into this trade for a buck 70. Yep. So, I'm going to post this trade right now. So, $1.70. And the reason I'm doing that is if I did an at the money, if I went 65 by 60, this pays two bucks. Uh if I went 62 by 57, that pays $1.90. Uh that's fair. I think if I did 65 55 by 50, I'm going to go after $1.75 in this trade. So, Nike bullput spread. Sell the 55 put, buy the 50 trade is pending. I'm going to post this in my alerts for Pinch Point. So, August 15th. All right. So, this trade was discussed Thursday during the master class. I like Nike for the April lows to be major support. So, I'm trying to position for a uh reasonable credit spread where I collect $1.75 credit on a $5 wide spread. So 3 25 max risk and I'm willing to own Nike if assigned with prices less than $50 by expiration. Okay, so that's going to be opinion order. Nike is in uh Delta Airlines. Let's go back to the charts. Delta started to move a little bit. Funions. So, we had about three or four days of pinching. It popped up in my scanner. Uh it's up around a dollar to a$150 right now. H maybe closer. Maybe closer to $2. Um I think this one when we looked at it yesterday, it was five wide. No fudge. Son of Hang on. Let me see this one. I might actually just take a live trade while I'm looking at it. So, earnings on the 10th. I was going to go out to the 25th and now we're trading at So, $6 expected move. Let me price this one out. So, we're trading around $51. If I buy the uh maybe the 52 and then the 49. Let me see what this looks like. So, if I go two wide, two wide, pay a $150 to make two bucks, that's clearly not going to work. Pay uh 215 to make $3. That's clearly not going to work. Pay 248 to make four. That's not going to work. All right, this one might be a little bit different. Maybe I can go here. A$1.17 to make two. That's a little bit better. $129 to make three. $155 to make three. That's That's closer. That's closer to 1 one. Now we're at $50.81 with a $6 expected move. Let's see if delta. So, let's put uh 50.81 + 6 puts me at 56. Well, that makes this trade worth potentially $3. That makes me money. Uh from 5081 minus 6 puts me at 44. That makes me money. uh from 48 down to 45. That makes me three and change. Uh I'm going to take this trade. So I'm going to take this trade here on Delta. See if we can get a buck 45. Hopefully this will fill. I don't want to pay more than uh A150 for it if I don't have to. Come on, Delta. You're more liquid than this. If I get up to A15 and it doesn't fill, then I will pass on the trade for right now. We can come back and circle back to this one on uh Monday. Come on, Delta. Criy. That's literally a one to one. Um son of a biscuit. I'll took I'll take 151 final offer. I'm three cents above the mid. Okay, I'm going to let this one Damn it. I'm going to put that one over the weekend. We'll come back and do this one on Monday. All right, so CE Duo ATA I'll look at those next week. Uh placing a trade on Nike. So this one's live and delta I will price out for Monday class on Uh let me check. Okay. So Sorry about that. Um, okay. Top down. Where are we at today? Pretty chill. Markets at 6002. I I mentioned this all week. You know, going back to my uh video I posted in YouTube on Trading View, all my channels, kind of my analysis for the week was look, we're getting awfully close to price just kind of going sideways. I do wonder if this trend line does matter. Uh, this is connecting, you know, it's it's a pretty steep trend line. I'm not going to lie. Like, this is a very steep trend line. I don't think that this necessarily means like, oh my gosh, the bulls are losing steam. It's broken. All this means to me is that the trajectory of this meltup is starting to fade. Okay, so here's going to be the the the most important thing in my opinion. We take these last couple weeks of price action. We watch these levels very very closely. Okay. So, I've got this this, you know, trend line here. Um, let's go a little bit thicker and go from these lows. Okay. Is it possible that this market is running into a bit of a rising wedge? Maybe. Now, rising wedges work one of two ways. You have prices making higher lows. You've got momentum is clearly fading at the tops. There's two ways to trade this. Okay? If you try to trade this early inside the wedge, sometimes you are completely disappointed because the market just goes boop and keeps going higher. Okay? If you wait for this to break, a little pullback or a pause can end up being a really, really good trade to the downside. The key, in my opinion, is waiting for that confirmation. And that's what we don't have yet. We don't have any real sign or evidence that this market is breaking lows, breaking lows, getting into some open space, and correcting. If it does, I don't think it's a bad trade to look at this. I don't think it's a bad trade to look at this as reasonable pullbacks, right? What is the catalyst? I have no idea at this point. You know, look, we've literally have, you know, one of the richest men in the world and Donald Trump are president fighting and the market doesn't care. We have US and China that maybe are coming to terms, maybe they're not. The market doesn't care. You know, we have the Euro zone that is like cheap price to earnings and there's repatriation going back to it. The market doesn't care. You know, it's like I don't know what the market's going to care about all of a sudden, unless it's earnings are terrible and the Fed's going to do something weird or maybe the bond it's like the bond market had its flinch. It's kind of been repaired. Um, it's not a good thing. I just think it's making people move away from bonds this year. But, uh, Larry, I I was I was thinking about you today. Uh, another 10K for daily profit play today. That's fantastic, man. That's a hell of a week, Larry. Larry absolutely murdered it this week, making 10 grand every day. Um, Larry, you're going to have a lot of jealous traders, man. They're going to wonder, \"What's your secret?\" And he's going to say, \"I just take a simple strategy and uh trade a boatload of contracts.\" But hopefully it's good risk management there, Larry, because making 50 grand in a week is pretty darn good, man. But I'm super happy for you. That's great. And yeah, today was today was great. even though we went like way out of the money today, at least I did. Um, worked out pretty well. So, anyway, let me get back to this this thought. So, does that make sense? I mean, unless price is going to take out this low or take out this low or break this structure. Okay, I mean, this could still be melt up, melt up, melt up, melt. But even if we're on the right hand side of the trend line, doesn't mean anything. Okay, what wins is price. If price pushes lower, then all of a sudden we are having a real conversation around a correction, right? Because if we just go sideways and sideways and sideways and hit the top of this trend line, then we hit the all-time highs, then we sweep these lows. Well, there's your timing, you know? So, all I'm saying is just watch price. And and I I can't make it any simpler than that. I don't think there's any reason to make it harder than that. And that is effectively what the rest of this, you know, month looks like. I mean, I don't know if we're going to have a fast June. I don't know if we're going to have a a real, you know, awesome June. It's like, okay, we had non-farm payroll today. What's next? What's next week? Um, I don't think the market's going to give us any real hint. If I look at next week's uh data, let's go to next week on typically like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, we start to see the inflation numbers. So, next week should be US PPI and CPI numbers. I can get a snapshot on the Forex Factory calendar. So, let's go to next week. [Music] Um, so next week, Wednesday, we have CPI. So, Wednesday CPI, I'll make this. So, I'm just going to look at Wednesday CPI. So, let's go Wednesday, Thursday next week. That's the data that I'm interested in. So, Wednesday, Wednesday's P uh CPI, Thursday's PPI inflation data for the US. Here is Wednesday. What I want to look at is do we have any forecasts? We don't. What we do know is that month over month, year-over-year, are we going to see trends that are the same or lower? So, here is an example to grab this as well. I'll take a look at your uh inflation data CPI year-over-year. So, we have been trending a little bit lower. So, between the CPI and PPI year-over-year, let's take a look at these these latest readings. Come on. There we go. All right. Cool. Let's refresh. What? All right. Looks like I need to get a new edge finder. All right, that's fine. I'll contact A1 Trading. So, I'm looking at the calendar. Me take a screenshot of this for them. Is everybody at All right. So, I was looking at the uh year-over-year. So, on Wednesday core year-over-year 2.8 was the previous print. My question is, are we going to print lower than that? Uh year-over-year for reg headline CPI 2.3. Are we going to print lower than that? Here is the latest reading from a third party inflation party which is um true inflation. Now we've been going up and I mean what's interesting is this move lower um we saw 2.3% has been our lower headline reading and we've been going up a little bit off those lows. This was like 1.6 1.7. Uh this was down to 1.2 at some point 1.22 22 and peaked back up that that's a 8% increase. So, uh I think I was looking back at this like maybe 3 4 weeks ago when we were up here around 3% then all the way down to 1.2%. The headline CPI was around like basically 3% up here. This is headline CPI down to about 2.3%. Okay, so the headline reading was a 7% improvement. So plus um well I should say minus I guess since it was a traction. So we had about a uh.7% improvement in CPI. Okay. True inflation went from uh around 3.1 to 1.2. So 3.1 minus 1.2. So 1.9%. would be true inflation. So TF for true inflation, right? So as a percentage, I'm just wondering um okay, so we have 1.9 how many? And this is like rough math here, but like uh.7 goes into 1.9. It's 37% of the move. So we go from a 1.2 back up to like a 2.1 uh 2.1 minus 1.2. 2 is 0.9 times.36. Maybe there's like a.3% difference. So I'm wonder and and this is probably lagging, but like I'm wondering if our our headline CPI at plus 2.3 is going to escalate up to like a a 2.4 uh maybe a 2.5. You know, this catch the market off guard next week maybe because what's it going to show us? Tariffs maybe are causing more inflation. Inflation is still sticky. It's not going away. We're a long ways from 2% inflation, right? So, I I think that this is still a story that has consumers attention if we're reading that inflation is higher. What's every media outlet going to run with? Inflation is higher, you know, and people are going to start buckling down a little bit more, bracing for higher prices. They know things are getting more expensive. Um, that could turn the markets obviously a little bit, but maybe not. So, anyway, um, at least have some catalyst next week. We'll probably have some volatility. We'll see if CPI uh matters enough to give us some price action. Make sense? So, that's what I'll be watching for next week. Uh 2.8 is the core. 2.3 is the headline year-over-year. If you go into Wednesday for PPI, uh core PPI for the year, previous is 3.1 and headline PPI was 2.4. So again, I typically watch the year-over-year to see if that's getting better or not. Um, and I'll get access to uh the the A1 trading edgeinder and we'll get that updated. I just actually I think I just got it updated. So now there we go. Now I can bookmark this. Okay. So now we can take a look at those numbers. So we'll go into inflation data year-over-year CPI. This is what I was talking about. So 2.3 is the previous. There's our target inflation at two. Coming into next week, are we going to be the same or higher? The reason I'm just bringing this up is because we've been going off of the lows with true inflation since April of this year. So from April to now, inflation's headed higher. So if this is reflecting in a, you know, government news report, are we seeing this go slightly higher? Because I think the argument is like, oh, we're so close to 2%. I think the argument is that we're never going to get to 2%. You know, I mean, I don't know if you've paid attention to life at all in the last 5 years, but things are certainly not cheaper. Um, house prices, we have the most unaffordable housing market ever based on median household median household income and median home price. Uh, interest rates exacerbate that. We have insurance that's up like anywhere between 50 to 100% what it was like the last five or so years. Uh, that's that's medical insurance. That's also um like homeowners insurance. That's car insurance. Like in freaking sane what people are just paying above just maintaining you know life life uh life bills. So stupid stuff. So nobody's going to are or nobody's going to be uh supporting like oh yeah inflation is definitely lower on what everything's more expensive. Like I don't know what's cheaper. Honestly I don't know what's cheaper. Like tell me something that's in price besides something that's on sale, you know, but like everything is more expensive. Rack rates of everything is more expensive. Uh my brother was just telling me about uh he coaches a a basketball team. He was just going to get jerseys for the kids and uh they usually do it with a like a mom and pop shop that's, you know, $27. Like it's a it's a warm-up shirt for for, you know, their their team. It's like $27. They do it for 20 plus kids and um you know, no big deal. got like 27 27 this year it's like 37 bucks did their cost really go up that much or is like are they just so like why I mean how you know so anyway that's just one example all right yeah Sam I agree with you not get it too I just think it's it's so far away and it's unrealistic compared to what life has actually seen All right. So yeah, 2% I I mean I I listen to some pretty smart people out there. They're just saying that the Fed should adjust it to 3% and then start doing work on monetary policy. Because if the reason they are holding off on doing anything with interest rates is simply because they want to see a 2% inflation rate, we're not going to get there. Therefore, they keep pausing and eventually something breaks and eventually they're going to have to cut because something else is happening on the back end and it's going to be a bond market snafu or a dollar snafu or the market's going to have a hissy fit. Who knows? But if we just adjusted and said, \"Look, our target inflation rate is now 3% or somewhere within a range of 2 to 3%.\" It's called modern monetary policy. And in here, they can be less restrictive because we've now been operating since last August that we've been sub 3%. So the whole mandate of we want to get inflation below our target inflation rate, we want to get inflation below our target inflation rate. If they say it's 3%, they can do that. I don't think the market's going to have a problem with this. if the Fed just adjusted inflation and said, \"Look, we're we're operating realistically within a two to three% inflation range.\" And and maybe this isn't Powell. Like that's the thing is maybe Powell is not that guy. Maybe when he is done next year, I think he's done in May of next year, we have a new Fed chair and maybe this is the new mandate is is we basically adjust the uh target inflation level and Fed policy takes over and maybe they can ease a little bit because it's less restrictive if we have a you know two to 3% range in headline inflation and we're sitting here with the Fed mandate that says well as long as we're under our inflation rate we can do XYZ. make sense. So, this is a to be determined. I don't think Jerome Pal is a guy to do it. I I don't think drone pow and Donald Trump get get along very well together. Um, and that's not, you know, that's not Pal's fault in my opinion. I don't think it's any Fed's chair job to uh really have to play nice if it's, you know, you're being trolled and bullied online. I don't think Paul cares. Um, I think what Pal's legacy is going to be is don't let inflation go hyperinflation, right? Don't don't have to be a Paul Vulker where you have to raise rates to like 8 n 10 11% to squash inflation and then cause a crash recession. Um I don't think that that's Paul's legacy. I don't think he wants that. So I think it's um make sure nothing breaks um and hopefully, you know, quickly put out flames and fires like they did in 2023, the regional bank crisis. Uh put out fires like they did in 2022. But the Fed is always reactive. They're always late. They're never going to be proactive on anything. They've never been that way. And unfortunately what happens is the markets end up running too hot and the markets cause something to break and the Fed steps in and typically fixes it. Um this year the argument was that the Fed put was way lower, the Trump put was way lower, that Xiin Ping's put was way lower and Putin's put was way lower. We saw that, you know, the Trump put was was way earlier than I anticipated. I thought it was a good technical level 20%. How we got there, I thought it was a little silly. Um but the government pivoted very hard. The Fed did not the Fed's not doing anything. They might not want to do anything this year. they might not want to cut rates at all. So anyway, uh let's see here. GDP as to grow us out of this mess. Um yeah, but that's the thing, Sam, is I don't think we can. I think we can say we're going to grow our way out of it, but do you know how perfect we have to be to grow our way out of this? I mean, if you're at 22 times earning for your index, you know how you know how great the economy has to go for you to grow your way out of 22 times earnings? the the the the scatter uh the scatter plot that I have here. Where's the heck is my Where's my chart? Weird. Weird. My window stuff doesn't work. Huh? All right. I'm trying to bring up Oh, never mind. I'm trying to bring up my menu down here. What the heck? Oh boy, I'm breaking stuff. So I say all that and f like, so we're going to see more downside. I don't know. All I'm all I'm talking about is um this the scatter plot of if we're at 2122 times earnings, the returns moving forward on an annualized basis are usually pretty terrible. So the only thing I can think of that would give us a good year in 2025, when I'm talking good year, I mean more than 10%. Like we are literally at like flat right now, aren't we? If you go to sector performance year to date, it's not amazing. Like we're up 0.98% for the S&P now. People might It's funny like you might be celebrating a 0.98% win because the market's not down for the year, right? Like I don't know if that's a good thing or bad thing. Um industrials up 9% and utilities up almost 7%. These are not exciting sectors at all. Um and again industrials is led by just a couple of of big big swinging weights. I mean GE Aerospace, this is more like defense spending than anything else. Uber Uber's in industrial holdings. It's up 40%. I have no idea how this is industrial holdings, but it's interesting mix. Caterpillar, Boeing, you put Uber in the same category as those, right? Railroads, John Deere. Anyway, GE Aerospace is more like defense spending. So, anyway, point is, um, is the market going to be excited about like 1 to 5% this year? I mean, I' I'd say if it's going to be a good year, the market's going to have to somehow get to 10 10 plus percent. Um, but 10% is like, okay, that that's great. Like, it's above historical averages, but what if we're up 4% this year? I mean, think about this. If if the S&P is up 5% in 2025 year to date, and inflation is still 3%, you're you're basically breaking even, which as a long-term investor should not be a big deal. You just stay the game, you stay the course, you keep investing, and you go, but it's just supposed to go up as money supply goes up. That's really the correlation. But my point is, if we have lackluster returns moving forward and we're trying to grow our way out of this thing, it's like, how do we grow our way out of this? Like, we're priced for perfection. If we grow our way out of this, this has to be like this AI boom that is like maybe the euphoria that everyone that like maybe Wall Street thinks AI is it's it's the only thing that saves us. Now, it's not saving us as in like humans because AI is coming for 90% of the jobs. Right. And government's not ready for that. And AI corporate profits aren't ready for that. I mean, if you have if you're going to displace a high percentage of your workforce, countries are not ready to do that. Corporate profits would love to see that. Okay. But at some point, what's the government going to do? If if a company like, you know, I won't use Tesla because now Trump and uh Musk are fighting, but let's say Amazon. Amazon goes full humanoids and full auto and everything for their warehouses and the final end delivery is all like autobased, right? There's no more drivers. It's all it's all AI, whatever. Let's say that Amazon is so profitable, 90 plus% profit margins, but they're firing millions and millions of workers. Okay, what if the government says, \"Amazon, you guys are so profitable. Congratulations. you're now going to have to pay this type of like universal basic income tax in order to help offset the workers that you've replaced. You know, it's like government could do that. So, I don't know. I'm just saying like this whole idea of growing way out of it. The the the theory is this. Okay. You you have three choices. Okay. You have three choices. You have uh austerity. Okay. You have uh growth and you have print. So which one have we done the most of? Which one have we done the most of? What is the reason that the US has grown year-over-year through COVID to now? We are still printing money and we are still stimulating our economy as if we have crisis level type um needs which we do not. We are operating at high deficits. We have raised the debt ceiling to an embarrassing amount. Our our debt has ballooned from, you know, $10 trillion to $30 trillion in the last decade. It's ridiculous. So to say that we're going to grow, look, we started this year with actual support to say, you know what, we allow some spending cuts. We would be happy to see some spending cuts. We'd be happy to see some government responsibility, accountability. Well, that'd be austerity for that's never supported. Nobody's going to I mean, nobody but really Donald Trump in in recent 20, 30 years has run on a austerity-driven campaign to promise cuts to the government, corruption, blah blah blah. And what did he do? He pivoted like it's not even a thing. We had austerity in theory and then we went, \"Nope, that's not going to work. I'm sorry. We're going to break something. So, we're just going to go away from that and we're going the other way.\" Now, we're saying we're going to grow our way out of it. Okay? We are going to grow our way out of it with perfection. There's no way that we can grow our way out of something that's already priced at a 21, 22, 23 times earnings. There's no way. I don't think as a whole 500 companies in the world can grow our way out of it. I don't think that the small caps of 2,000 stocks can grow their way out of it because they don't make any money. They can't refinance at four, five, 6% corporate rates. They need 0% interest rates to grow their way out of it. And all it is is debt that is refinanced, not paid back. So growth, I am very skeptical of our ability to grow unless we're coming from a 14 times earnings. Unless we're coming from like a reset type earnings, which was a great financial crisis in 2008, the bottom of 2009, we're at like 12 or 13 times earnings. Lots of room to grow. We were at the same levels that Europe is right now. Europe is like 12 13 times earnings. The US is 21 22 times earnings. If you want money to go to where it could be treated best for growth sake, everything has to be right in the US, things have to go moderately well in Euro Euro zone, you know. And I'm not saying they're the same markets. Like the US markets are the biggest, the most liquid. We have some of the biggest companies in the world. We have companies that are so big, they're bigger than countries, okay? But to say we're going to grow our way out of it, I feel like it sounds good, but it's not realistic. Because if we grow our way out of it, how does that how does that affect our debt? We're probably going to grow our debt more. So, do we outpace our debt? How do we service debt? If we're paying back debt at 3% interest, 4% interest, if yields go higher, we're paying it back more. Or the Fed, you see what I'm saying? It's like, I just don't think it's realistic. We'd have to grow like we'd have to have like parabolic growth to really get ahead of this. And if we have parabolic growth, it's because profit margins are so high that all of a sudden there's no more labor. Like, nobody's working. if we're going to have like crazy high profit margins. But since 2020, and I I I shared this chart, um I I have a I have a screenshot of it was like since 2020, the amount of labor growth in Mag 7 has been like going to zero. They're not hiring people. You know, tech has been secretly phasing out jobs for the last couple years and it's getting like those jobs probably aren't coming back. So, I just have a big question mark around our ability to say we're going to grow our way out of it. I don't think we will. I think what we do is we try like we we'll give it the old college effort. We'll try to grow and we'll realize, oh my gosh, we can't. And then what do we do? We'll print. So, we'll raise our debt ceiling. We'll increase our deficits. We'll print more money. We'll add more to liquidity. Everyone gets cheap money. We debase our currency. We increase or we decrease purchasing power. But the money supply goes handinhand with the ups in the markets. So it looks like on paper we're growing our way out of things and prices are better and the the markets are at all-time highs, but if all we're doing is purchasing power goes down, it just means things are more expensive and we have higher debts and higher rates to service it, I just don't know how this is a good thing. So again, it's a pickle, man. Like I think the Fed is in a pickle. I think that Trump and this administration is in a pickle. I think the markets are smarter than all of it. I think the markets ultimately are going to tell us exactly how this plays out, you know, and if the markets play out with like, you know what, if the US is going to hyperinflate itself and we have just crazy highs and the S&P is at 10,000 in 5 10 years, I don't want to be the one to call the top. But you almost have to participate in that stupid meltup in order just to get break even, you know? But the but the turning point is if we want to grow our way out of it, but labor isn't supported, if we have people that are losing jobs and losing jobs that are not coming back, we're not growing out of anything. What we're doing is we're growing a a a class of workers now that have nothing to to do, that have nothing to to to, you know, contribute. And again, the market ultimately will tell us like what does it mean? Because I don't know what it means. I don't know what any of this is like. Are we going to all-time highs? We're never looking back at 7,7500 plus on S&P. Are we going to dip down to, you know, 4,000 again? Are we dipping down to 4,500 again? I have no idea. But we're not doing austerity right now. That's for sure. We pivoted hard. April 9th, that was the pivot. Growth sounds good. We just have too much crap going on. We're fighting way too much internally. And it's just too much noise and too much drama. If we wanted to grow our way through this, we have to grow through this global trade war. Like tariffs on the world is not a way to grow. It's created more friction, more supply chain issues. We're not coop we're not cooperating or collaborating with the world. Globalization makes everything cheaper and more plentiful and more accessible. We're not doing that anymore. So, do we fix it? Maybe, but we're essentially going to have to pivot back on what this whole tariff policy started with. Tariffs, it's it's it's a it's a bit of a tax, I guess. Um, but it's it's not a revenue generator. Like, the fact we're looking at this is like it's part revenue. we're going to we're going to make so much money on tariffs and like to do what? I don't know. So, it's a weird plan. I think the whole thing is just a big pickle. You got to watch price action. The markets are the smartest thing. They'll tell us what to do, you know. So, anyway, and if and if at the same time if any of this happens where jobs are lost, the market's going to tell us exactly what to do, which is if people are losing their jobs, the recession is going to start gaining more traction. a recession that we have literally been feeling. Rolling recessions since 2020 have been felt by everybody, right? You're you're working harder, making less money, things are more expensive. It's this sector one time, it's this sector another time. It's just being felt in all different nooks and crannies of the economy. Ultimately, it's like we don't have a broad recession where everything is down, but we are getting like this rolling transitional recession where everything is just kind of it's having its moment where it's like it's struggling and then it comes back. while something else struggles and it comes back. It just feels like we're we're like leaprogging into who's actually supporting the economy. Mag 7 has been like the one awesome thing that's like, yeah, I guess big tech and services can still do well. If consumers are spending money and we've got big tech leading the charge, the markets can go higher. But if consumers pull back and tech starts to slow or we stop growing or people start losing jobs, it's just a very slippery slope where all of a sudden like price will tell us that things are getting a little bit more fragile and things will start to fall. So, that's what I'm saying. I think ultimately like this is a pickle. I think that you've got a government that's uh backed itself into a corner that doesn't understand how to detox. And I think you have a Fed that refuses to be proactive and they're always reactive. And so, they just sit back and wait for something to break before they step in. And you've got an economy that is being led essentially by the strength of the 10 and 20% demographics that are supporting the rest of the economy, but the bottom is struggling. and the top decides to get standoffish or the top decides to pull back or get more conservative, that's going to translate into lower spending, lower consumption, and that's when you'll see like prices will reflect that, you know. So, we'll see. Um, so yeah, I mean, honestly, this whole conversation feels like it could be 3, 6, 12 months from now when it really starts to take effect. But until then, I mean, if we look at the the broader market, we're sitting here just like this weird kind of melt up. We're at 6,000 today. I mean, oh my god, that would have been a perfect freaking pin. I was I was wondering if it was going to pin at 6,000 today. That would have been a fun little iron butterfly to take. Pin that thing and make literally like $500 for a tiny little risk. Uh anyway, whatever. Um but are we going to still kind of sniff out these all-time highs? You know, again, next week inflation data, we will see. I think you can all see the same charts, right? The same charts that I see. Are we going to keep melting up here to find all-time highs? Are we going to have any type of noise where maybe we pull back again, right? Pull back again to this low. Watch this level, maybe a rising wedge. I'm going to go to this trend line here. Okay, watch the watch the the futures market. So, futures closes here in about an hour. Um, if we go into the weekend, we open up on Sunday. I mean, for me, the futures market has the ability to keep running up, test alltime highs, but if it sweeps the low, sweeps the lower, or even starts to sweep the low here, then we're due for a correction. If we if we hit all-time highs and we sweep lows, we're due for a correction, right? So, we will see. So, new next week's a new week. Uh we'll watch our levels. It's been a really slow couple of weeks, you know, and it's been okay. I mean, we we grind. That's what we got to do. We got to grind. So, any thoughts, questions, comments? Just um you know, buckle up. I I think it's going to be an interesting next like 3 to six months. I think this whole like 90-day pause, summer trading, you know, summer can be tr tough sometimes if we have like big surprises. The markets are pretty low volume and I'm not saying they're illquid, but they can be low volume and it doesn't take a lot of money, especially the amount of leverages in the system. It doesn't take a lot of money to move the market aggressively. So, if we start to see like some crazy surprises, you know, maybe something happens in Japan like it did last summer. Uh maybe we we found out the, you know, the trade war conversation is not going as as well as planned. Maybe the whole world isn't lining up to negotiate with the US. Maybe we're still struggling to deal with China, but the market right now doesn't seem to care and price isn't suggesting that anything is happening bad. It's just slow. Okay, but I will say this, Tuesday data, Wednesday data or Wednesday, Thursday data for inflation next week. I think it's Tuesday, Wednesday. Uh Wednesday CPI. Okay, so we have uh uh Wednesday and Thursday. So coming into next week, uh we've got bank holidays in the Euro zone. That's good. That actually that should be a pretty slow day on Monday then, which is kind of good. Um, and then light news on Tuesday, big news on Wednesday. Um, I' I'd love to see some chill price action on Monday, Tuesday, uh, for my daily profit play. And then we'll see if the if the data unfolds here where it's, you know, year-over-year. I mean, we're forecasting higher. Here's CPI year-over-year forecast 3.5. So, we're we're looking at a higher print. Okay. I mean, I said if we get to 2.5 2.6, it makes sense based on that trueflation uh, uptick. So, what does that do to this? We go from 2.3 back up to 2.5. We're all a sudden breaking trend. Does the market panic because of that? Does the market not like that? I don't know. Okay. Uh what's your analysis on Euro dollar? I mean, it's a pullback, man. I'm still long Euro dollar, but I think a pullback is likely. Um I think if we have a high low, lower high, lower low, lower high, lower low, maybe this before it eventually goes back up. Um, if it's, you know, dollar try dollar tries to retest the lows, then the Euro dollar tries to retest the highs, that's my trade. So, I'm still sitting here. I'm I'm up 200 bucks. So, I mean, if it goes up to retest the high, I I'm going to try to get 1,500 or higher and I'll take a profit and I'll cancel my my my trades. I'm just dollar cost averaging in. I think right now, if you are, you know, trying to look to sell the Euro dollar, there's resistance right there. You can look for some trend line confirmation, stay out of the way, go after a pullback. But until then, it's like to me this is a way to buy small, buy small, buy small, trying to get back to the highs. If the dollar index tests the lows, then goes back up. I think that pokes the highs and then falls. So, nothing. I mean, honestly, I think that the dollar with such a big move, I mean, we haven't seen a move like this in, you know, years. Like, this is like one of the worst years we've seen for like 30 years. Would anybody be surprised to see this move just end up doing this? Part of me would not be surprised to see this dollar become very boring, you know, and it's and it's almost suppressed intentionally. So, I'm just not hold my breath for like all this wild and crazy volatility when the market just kind of contains, you know, and condenses. So, anyway, all right, I'll let you go. I'm going to jump over to my master class, uh, Pinchoint Scanner Masterass coming up in just a minute. So, we got members standing by.
