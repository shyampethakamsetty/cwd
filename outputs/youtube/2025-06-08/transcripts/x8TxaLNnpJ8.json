  "transcript": "Is the market about to flip and are traders completely missing this signal? Non-farm payrolls came out strong, but what's really moving the money in the market right now? And we're going to dive into that number in detail. Tesla is sitting at a major inflection point and the Trump Elon feud could be the wild card no one's pricing in. This might actually get worse, not better. We're going to dive into it in great detail. I'll show you exactly how I'm trading Tesla and what names are setting up for next week. We're going to have to spend some time talking about where momentum can accelerate. And I think it's actually setting up to reverse and set a new trend. We're going to spend some time on this. Let's get to it. Hey everybody, welcome back. To start with, everyone's very excited about this 6,000. And I get it. It's something to be excited about, but I think the devil's really in the details here. As always, subscribe to the channel, click all notifications cuz what we go over here is very, very timely. And these videos come out at different times. All these videos are actually linked together starting with Saturday and then they just kind of follow through on the week. Let's get to it. I think it's more important to start with the focus on Friday and just know that this is where we are on non-farm payrolls and that's the move. And as always, I suggest that people on the short-term trading side mark off that first 8:30 bar. It always gives you a sense of where they are, where the traders are, and then you can kind of see how we act, rally, act, and kind of go from there. I think it's super important to get this. Why? Because it shows you where the algorithms are. Everyone says they can't win because of the algorithms, and the algorithms tell you exactly where they're trading. It's just up for you to kind of spot them and set up a process for that. And they usually just wick you down in those areas, use them as liquidity, and then they just rip it in your face. And that's exactly how you can spot it so it stops doing that. But overall in the week, it was not really a bad week, was it? You know, if you kind of take a look at it, you were all over the place. But did you did you really have a bad week? No. I think that you are hitting these higher highs, but at the same time, you're not really going anywhere, are you? If you take a look at it, no, you're really not. So, there's there's some rotation here and I think we should talk about it. And I'll give you another example before we dive into it. I mean, here's here's NQ. Where have you gone, right? Thursday 29th, you got bonked up here. Bonk bunk bonk. And now you have this rising wedge. I'm not knocking the rising wedge, but it does it does concern me a little bit. And if we drop it to some of these levels, you can see you keep hitting these highs on the NQ where you're just getting all spiky up here. Watch this on the hourly as well. And then you're just not going anywhere. So, I think it's a little bit of an issue and I think that you're a little tired in some of these. And one of the things that I do tend to look at are these negative divergences and this one's, as somebody would say, absolutely glaring. Does that mean that it's definitely going to happen and you can't work it off? No, you can, but it might mean that we're just going to go sideways. And if you've watched these videos for some time, you know that AVGO tends to mark that sideways to down action. And we're going to go through that in some detail here in a second because it's super important to get. People miss that. But take a look at this. In front of you is RTY or the small cap index. And you're going to see this kind of lift right in here and you're building in here. But let's take a look at this in some detail. I do like how the RSI here on the 4 hour looks a lot better than any of the other indexes. I also like how you keep knocking on this door and it's getting tighter and tighter. You could argue that you have some kind of wonky head and shoulders here. I don't really see it, but I guess you could make the argument. What I really see is a base from May that you've just been hitting over and over and over again and it's getting tighter and that's really what I want to see. I I like this kind of action. I think it's super important to look at this on a five for a sec and just kind of drop down and go, \"Okay, well, if we were to kind of understand which one is flipping that Thursday level, in other words, if we went back and looked at the NQ and the ES, which one's actually flipping? like which one of these is actually breaking out, holding in here, and looks like it's going to push. It's actually the Russell. Watch this. Now, if we look at what's going on here, I have just the NASDAQ and the ES and the futures cuz it's easier for it to carry through. And what do we see here? We see the NQ, we see the ES, we see RTY. And what what's important about this? Well, you know, just going from that from that futures. I'm going back to Monday. they just rolled it back, but because it's more important about the disparity between how this one's just being completely left out after dropping lower than all of them and and where we're at with it. I just think it's really important. Now, watch when we start zooming and it really starts happening in May. And I don't think a lot of people are picking it up. And I I'll be blunt. I wasn't really picking up on it because I was more focused on the on the NASDAQ and and watching what's going on with AI because that's really driving GDP growth right now. But take a look at this and watch how this is playing out for us. Here's RTY ES and Q. Okay, look where we're at right now from May on. But wait, there's more. This is June and from June on and I think you're seeing some really important distinctions here and I certainly saw it in the names that we were trading in the community. You could see the difference. If you are on the wait list, look for a letter going out this week. Uh some of the invitations are going out. If you're trying to get into the community, then just make sure you get your name um on the weight list and that is of course in the description and sometimes I pin it if I remember. But if you if you're looking at this what happened in day well this sideways sideways which one broke out what was the one they had to get in on Friday like hey we need exposure this one we need exposure to small caps in printing. So they're telling you and why is this so important? Fridays are where institutions start doing the rebalancing. So, it's always on Fridays. It's always that end of day Friday where you'll see the rebalancing, like the real rebalancing. And that's super important to get. See, institutions, what they do is they'll go out there and say, \"We want to buy X, Y, and Z.\" But then they'll look at their book by Friday and say, \"Okay, well, we didn't buy enough of that, so now we have to go out and buy more of that.\" And that's exactly what's happening here. Super important. Take a look at this as well. In front of you are the main sectors of small cap, and you can see where you are on IWM, and you can see which ones are leading. you just type these, but I'm not going to spend all that time on it because frankly we have a lot to cover. But you're down basis points here on certain on certain sectors. You're not down majorly on these sectors since June. And this just shows massive rotation into all the sectors in small cap which have been beaten down. This is actually a really good sign for the market. What I think is most important is not only this, but some of the other stuff that we're seeing in regards to non-farm payrolls and the movement that we're seeing in the market with uh this recent bounce. But I think we should cover it in two steps. I think we should cover non-farm payrolls and what happened and then I think we should cover what happens when what happens really when the S&P is down like this three in a row and then runs 5%. it it's only happened 16 times, but these drops in 5% month moves have happened 120 times since the market's been open. And I do think it's important to go over that de data. But I want to cover non-farm payrolls first and then I want to tie this all together and then we're going to start taking a really hard look at Tesla. So let's get to it. Now looking at non-farm payrolls, there's a couple things here. You keep hearing the news in my opinion just keep talking about the fact that oh there's a slowing going on. I don't really view it as a slowing and and I think that this is important just to spend a moment on this before we dive into it, but I do think there's some problems here with non-formed payrolls that we have to watch. If we just kind of come across here, we'll see that this is when we went through our, you know, hope and change feel when uh the election happened and then reality sets in and now this is what we're dealing with and we can kind of see that drop uh the rise and then people are like, \"Oh, well, it's declining.\" You're seeing a lot of this in the headlines. Oh, it's declining. It's not declining. you you drop from month to month because one was revised but overall just understand that if you had to say from 25 on what's going on it's actually going in line to higher I would suggest and if you took this 3-month average and then you took this 3-month average you're going to be higher and that's usually how the Fed looks at this data I don't see anything in this data that's going to make the Fed act but there is some stuff here we should look at and we can take a second and just look at the actual numbers and this is what we were dealing with we went through November where everybody got excited and December, everybody ramps up and then you go into January and then we got a little bit of liberation and now it seems like we're starting to level off a little bit in here. And just sometimes just looking at the numbers, you can say, \"Oh, okay.\" Because a lot of these headlines out there are saying, \"Oh, well, this is bad and that's bad.\" No, it's just because of this decline. I don't think anyone should really care about that. I think they should look at the the last three and then look at the next three. And I think that's a really good way of looking at it. Now, one of the things I'm having a hard time understanding is the XLY and why it's not catching on. So, you can actually go through the BLS data and pull it out piece by piece. And there's a couple things that I I noticed here. Um, if we look at adult men 20 years and over, this is a minus one, which means there was less of them working. And then you get into adult women 20 years and over. Now, we're going to make a generalization here that, okay, they m we don't know if they're married and they they have to go back to work. We don't know if the bills are getting stretched. But it's interesting that adult women 20 years and over are kicking up and adult men actually had a decline. What's most interesting about this number is when you had to break it down by category, teenagers are where the most growth came from on this number. And I think it's worth pointing that out. Then if we just break this down by education level, again, I think it's just important to look at that and go, \"All right, well, on the bachelor degree side, yep, we did see an increase, which is good.\" But some college or associate degrees, that kind of fell by the wayside, didn't it? And if you don't have a high school degree, that was just an absolute dumpster fire. But it's the high school that really for the high school graduates that got that job. So we have teenagers that are graduating high school that are going right to work. So you're looking at that and going, okay, well, it's kind of that time of the year where people just graduated and then they get a job. So is this is this that inflation where that we're seeing in the number? Meaning not inflation, but is that why the number was where it was? And then we get into, well, what kind of work are they getting? Well, this is why household surveys are so much better sometimes than non-farm payrolls. Well, part-time for non-economic reasons. Well, part-time work for noneconomic reasons, meaning did you I wanted to go back. Well, that fell by the wayside. Why did you take a part-time job? Because that's all I could find. And that was your biggest category. And all these numbers, just so we're clear, it was teenagers that went back to work. And what I was saying earlier about if you look at it from like if you take a household and you look at adult women part-time for noneconomic reasons, well, that fell by the wayside. So then you could kind of skew that and say, well, they went back to work because people needed to go back to work. And when you start breaking it out that way, it doesn't look that way either. So, I'm not really sure how to look at this except to say that people went back to work part-time because that's all they could get. They always say the devil's in the details and and I think it is a little bit because you look at non-form payrolls, you look at the previous, you look at consensus and we look at average hourly earnings, you know, from the previous to consensus, it's up. So, that's good. Year-over-year, you're actually up versus what the consensus was. So, that's good. I think what you have to look at is the government payroll, the manufacturing jobs, but what you're seeing is the payroll private side really expanded versus where you were. And obviously the R means revised, but how much were those were like really good jobs versus part-time work? And I think that could be some of the devils in the details and that could be why we're seeing the XLY not lift the way that it should. Now, one of the things I like doing if you watch this channel is I do like looking at data. That data allows me to make a more informed decision on Palan which way we're going on the world and which way the way things are developed. And now this chart is marking off every month where the monthly open and close was up over 5%. And they go back pretty far. In this case, I believe they're going back to 1945. This is by Siment Trader. This is not by me. I have no affiliation with them whatsoever, but I've talked to them in the past about showing their research. And this piece to me was pretty interesting. And then they overlay another indicator with it. So, what happens in the market on a monthly close over 5%. What happens next? And some of these they might surprise you, they might not as well, but I do think it's interesting. So, when you get into the first and the second week, you start with that median just positive, positive, positive. And you can see the percentage times that you're positive in here. But what I do like about this is what you start seeing over here where it starts going higher and higher obviously as time goes on, which you would expect that to continue on a monthly chart. But the one thing you're always trying to figure out is is this statistically significant. Does it really matter? Now you have 120 signals. You need 30. 30 is statistical significant. And then it depends on the amount of variables, but you want at least 30. So you have that. So there is statistical significance to this. What I like about this is that when you start looking at the zcore here and now the zcore a week later from this happening, you're they're saying it's right where you are and that zcore shows significance when this happens. Meaning if the month closes there, it's fair to say that the next week 70% of the time is positive. Anytime that a monthly close is 5% or more, the next week 70% of the time is going to be positive. And this shows you your mean, your max gain, and your max loss. And then you start getting in the week two to week to month three. And you see this 87 and we'll stay here for a minute. And this isn't really saying, yeah, it's pretty much medium. And then it flips. But this six month later and 12 month later, these zcores of 43 and 38, that is really what you want to pay attention to. And even if you're down here, they start showing you where it says zcore plus -2 suggest significance. What you're looking for is statistical significance. Meaning, does this really mean anything or is it just, you know, garbage in, garbage out? And statistically speaking, yeah, this actually matters and it's definitely something you want to pay attention to for the later end of the chart, meaning the later end of the market. If you're looking out 6 to 12 months, do you really care about that you were up last month? And this is what's important. We all look at this data, but when does it matter? Well, it doesn't matter a month later. It doesn't really matter two two months later. 3 months later, you could say maybe. But if you were saying, okay, well, in May we did this. Well, when does that matter? Well, maybe it matters more in October or it matters more in November. And then you could really refine this. Now, before we go any further in regards to the next variable that they entered, I just want to be real clear about this because some people will look at this and say, \"Oh, I know I know what he's talking about with the Zcore and they and they don't.\" And that's okay because not a lot of people that trade actually bring this stuff up. But I do think it's important when you look at data. And the one thing I'm just pointing out is as with with the zcore, it's a statistical measure describes the position raw score in terms of distance from the mean. Meaning if this is the mean of where we usually are, how far over are we on either side? And then how skewed are we from there. And I think it's important. A positive zcore indicates the value lies above the mean, while negative means it's below the mean. Simple enough. I find graphs super helpful when I'm trying to learn things. I'm just a visual guy. So you can see it's also known as a standard score because it allows different variables to be compared standardizing the distribution. A normal distribution below shaped distribution with a mean of zero, standard deviation one. See the figure below. So if all things are equal, it's just saying hey your first standard deviation between here is going to be this 68 26%. And then your second standard deviation and if you anyone that plays with Ballinger bands, this is exactly what the Ballinger bands are telling you these percentage. And then you can see the third standard deviation down here and the percentage chance that you're going to be in there. So anytime you're out on a variable of like a third standard deviation, anything like that, you want to pay attention to it because it's not normal. Normal is anything that's in this range or sometimes anything that could even be in that, you know, one and a half, you might be like, okay, I get it, but that's still kind of skewed. But this, yeah, this you really want to pay attention to anything that you're out of when you're out of that, let's call it that 2% or that two standard deviation right here. And that's not really Zcore is different because you're dividing it by the mean. But when you think about it from a standard deviation standpoint, just think about it that way from that normal distribution. Anytime you're in between like a two and a three, you're getting goofy. Like you're getting to areas that you just normally don't see. And it's not rocket science. If I just color that in from these areas and you look at that, you can see how off you are. All right, one last point cuz I think it's important. The value of the zcore tells you how many standard deviations you are away from the mean. That's what it's telling you. Just understand that the further you are, the larger the absolute value. So now what they did is they put in their next variable. And the variable that they put in next is going to be if you're up 5% or more, which is fine. I mean that makes sense. Let's clean this off. We already know that we what that's going to do. what other variable do they add? So they come here and they go, well, let's look at 5% more after at least at least three months of consecutive declines. So after you have one, two, three, then they're saying, okay, well, if the next one's up 5%, what happened? This is where it gets super interesting. And just to refresh everybody's mind, why does this matter? because what we've had right here and of course this is June where we are right now but you have February, March and April which was just gross as we as we as we all got liberated and you can just see our level right here but you get the one two three down up all right let's go and on our screen that's going to give us 5% up three down more months and that's going to give us out of these indications I believe there were 16 times since 45 1945 this happened now when I read this study this was the part of the study that is most interesting to me. And it's also the part that is going to have less statistical significance because you only have 16 signals and you did go back to 47, but I'd like to have 30 to to be there, but but I don't. And now I have more variables and I have less examples of that variable. So just understand that that is an issue here when you look at data, right? Hopefully that makes sense. If not, just drop it in the comments. We'll go from there. All right. So here's 12 months. Boom. There's not really much to say. 12 months later when this happens, the 16 times it's happened since 47, you've been higher from that date a year forward, which would mean and the date that you would just use for it has got to be I mean it's not rocket science, guys. It's got to be the end of the month. So you would just go from June 1st off and start counting one week, two weeks, 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 6 months, right? What I do find really interesting about this is once you start getting further and further into it. Very rarely are you seeing anything that is giving you any indication that you're going to have any kind of problem. A matter of fact, what's really neat about it, if you took the three, the six, and the 12, and you looked at this, anytime you got that signal that was not in 1970, but previous of 1970, you were up every single time 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months later. And then really if you look at it in here, you only had 74 where you were down. If you wanted to go back into that two-month window and that one month window, you had this one, you know, five basis points or 50 basis points, I'm sorry, right here. But other than that, once it's on, it's on. And the percentage of being right on something like this is really very impressive to me. What I will say again, as I'm going over this, we've added one more variable, right? So you have one variable and you and you want statistical significance of 30 or more on it. And then when you add another variable, you actually want more signals. I don't have that. I can only play the hand that we're dealt. This is what we have. This is what the data suggests. And I do think there's significance in there. More signals would be better. Now again, I like looking at the data. If you find value in it, just let me know. I do like doing these. I do think that they're really helpful. But if I look one month, two month, 3 months, 6 months later, I'm not really focused on this. And I'll tell you why I'm not focused on this. I don't look at monthly charts and then try to figure out what's going to happen a week or two later. Like I think it's silly. I would look at weekly charts. When I look at something like this and this percentages of like 80% to me it's significant. Now when they run their study and they back test it and the reason for the back test is I'm not going to get into the whole zcore and how it's calculated but basically they take the mean minus the the um you know the way that you're off on the mean and then what they do is then they divide that and that's how they get their zcore. But for me, what's really important is this. Like you're on the 6 months later, you're at that 35. On the 12 month, you're at that 42. Like, if you go back to the other chart that I'm not going to bore you with, that is really statistically significant. So, I'm always interested in your comments on this stuff. I found this absolutely fascinating and I wanted to share it. Does that mean for sure that this time? No. Very, you know, this could be that one that knocks it down. But I do think it's worth paying attention to and it does fit what we're seeing in the market right now as far as rotation. I like incorporating free sites and this one is just maximumpaying.com. The reason I do that is just so that you guys I know it gets super expensive but you can see right up here what I'm using when looking at Tesla which is really I think presenting opportunity and the question really is okay thanks but how and I'll give you my my two cents on it. We think this is done. I don't know that we're done. So what we're looking at is Friday's close. You can see the time right up in here so you know exactly what you're looking at and the chart maturity date on what the option is that we're looking at. And there's a couple things that I think really stand out for me. It most important was hey where where are they really building these positions on options? And you can see it like right here on the open interest. Now what I think so interesting about this is you can see put and calls. When you're looking at this open interest build you'll be like okay well that's really that 300 level. That's not that exciting. But it's telling you more about the put side of this to me than anything else. The call side, them going out there and opening up these 400s for next week like we were going to bounce back. I think it's kind of crazy. But if you start looking at this, you're starting to see like these 350s. And what these are the people that I'm going to call the hopers and the dreamers. These are the people that are out there that are just throwing money against the wall and seeing what sticks. And you can kind of see they're the erratic, you know, the old quote these are quote unquote cheap. But then you start seeing something down here in like the 285 the 275 level where these guys are really we're going to we're going to get into this in the open interest in some detail here. Um 285 275 level where these guys are putting money to work and then we see the action that happened on Friday. We're going to get into options in some detail here. But then look at 250 and then you start looking at these levels. And this is I want to be real clear about what you're looking at here. This is open interest. This is not just volume. And I you know these people I don't know you know you never know right the idea that the open interest on these option is the same level roughly on where you are here to me is fascinating and it's think I think it's telling a story. You can go out there and say well these people are just you know they're going out there and seeing what you know what sticks. I look at this and go well you would think that you would see some kind of skew. Yep. And then you would see think you'd see a a wall. That wall in volume is pretty interesting. We'll get to the wall in volume but the amount of open interest that's staying open here. I mean, I I think it's something you have to pay attention to. You get where I'm going with this. Let's get into it. Now, before we go any further, I redid this chart and I I'll explain why. I think it's absolutely fascinating when people look at open interest in volume and really don't know what they're looking at. For those that don't know, I've been trading over 26 years kind of right now. I was fortunate enough to start when I was really young. And during that time, I went and got, you know, registered options principle. Did the whole thing. It was that for a decade. And there's a huge difference between what you're holding in options and what you're trading in options. There's an enormous difference. What I think's fascinating about this stuff is it shows you where their head is when you look at the open interest on maturity. And what we're going to do is we're actually going to stack other strikes so you can see where everybody's head is. Not only the strikes, but we're going to stack other expirations on top of that. And then we're going to take a quick look at the volume. But the volume's telling you one story on what they're doing during the day. The actual open interest and then how they're stacking in June is telling a completely different story. And it's that nuance where I think the money's at. But if we look at the open interest here, I had to mark it off because to me, as someone likes to say, it's absolutely glaring. 180, 200, 230, 250, 300. Like, you would think that this would be that huge put that you're on the other side of. They're still buying down here. When you start seeing the other strikes, it gets pretty obvious what they're doing. The bet right now is that this is skewing to the downside. What's so interesting is that when we get into the max pain, the max pain is still skewing for some of these to the upside, meaning the call looks like the max pain, but really where this starts to get skewed is when this starts dropping more. And I think that's interesting. I also think it's interesting that you have this spot right in here between 250 and 300. And you have some little areas like the 275, 285 area where you have some things going on. But I think it's really interesting that you don't have a lot going on in there right now. Let's jump into some of these other slides. This is how I use this. Everyone says max pain's this. So that's where it's got to go to because it's got to cause the max pain for everybody, right? Meaning not the market makers, but where's the max pain for the people, the people that own the options? And that's at 315. I would argue that the max pain here for everybody is this thing just continuing to drop. and the skews off the charts where you you know this is really where you are on the put side on what what's going to happen with the market makers and this is on the the high side and that's how I view this chart you should view it how you're comfortable with the important thing about data is once you have that data set you can do whatever you want with it you can use it any way that you want some people will look at 315 and say oh it's got a pin there I don't tend to look at this data and think that way and it can pin there yes 100% they might try to get it there I mean the markets might try and do that and of course anything can happen. But if you were to look at this and go, \"Well, all I got to do is bleed these people out on the buy side to get these people.\" Like, you would do that all day long. You'd spend X to make Y all day long. Now, when you look at the volume side of this and just, hey, what what were the crazy kids trading on Friday? What were they whacking around? You're just going to see this wall at 300. Everyone's going to go, \"Oh, well, that's where, you know, that's the cat's pajamas. That's where they're going to try to get you.\" And the data that I just showed you shows completely different. And I'm not saying you don't have interest around that 285, 295 and all this in here. I'm not saying that. Of course you do. Um, but this is volume and the volume's telling you a pretty different story between this is what they traded and this is what they held. And I think that that's a very important part to look at because one will tell you where like what people refer to a put wall or a call wall. The open interest is where it's at, not really the volume. Huge distinction. You'll you'll see this when we get into it strike by strike. We're going to start with the call and let me clean and and again what we're doing here is we're just looking at this and seeing if we can get into this and and find anything of value. And I think the calls have something but not as much as the puts. But you can see the strikes. I'm sorry. You can see the expirations right here. Need more coffee as we're doing this. But if you were to look at this and go, well, where are the, you know, where are the big strikes at? Well, you would go like, well, orange the 27s, you know, they're buying those 400s right here. All right, cool. Or four 450s. All right, cool. So, you kind of understand where people are. Here's your strikes. Here's your colors. and they're breaking it down. So, when you start looking at those colors, what are they really doing? You're not seeing, especially the blue, and this is hard to see here, but what you're really not seeing is you're not really seeing them buying a lot of in the money calls like at all. And is that normal? Kind of. I mean, you're seeing it more skewed this way, but you would think you'd see more in the money if people thought it was going to go. Like, if you really thought it was going to go next week, you'd see more in the money in my opinion. What you are seeing is some speck out here around that let's call it the you know let's call it that 320 level right in here. I think when you think about it that way, like okay, like I I think when you I'm trying to use this drawing tools as I'm doing this, I'm not going to have time to I think it's interesting. Sure. Like is that going to be a call wall you have to watch maybe if it starts to rally? Sure, why not? But where where are you around that 300? Like you don't really have a lot there. You have some for next week, but you don't really see the the masses going out and saying, you know what, I need the 627s for you see more speculative on the week than you're seeing anything else. And I I think that's kind of interesting. Sure, you're going to see some, but the people that are buying these other options, they're going out further on those options. They're not saying, \"I want to be in this longer term.\" And I think that's important. So, to me, what does that mean? I think it means that they're trying to play the bounce. The we're going to bounce and then we're going to sell. That's very different from investment. It's more speculative trading, right? So, I'm just going to say that again. If you're out here and you're looking, this to me is specking. Like, if you're buying the 627s, you're specking because you're you're not in the money. If you're at like that 300 and you saw this huge spike in like the 627, 620, there are people that are there to stay and they're trying to, you know, hold that name and they're using options as an option to own the stock. You're not getting that. You're getting the spec on the call side. But look at look at the difference when I explain this on the put side. Here you are at 245 open interest on puts. So when people are like, well, where's the real, you know, put quote put wall? Is it, you know, the 270 where you do see some? out, but you're not really seeing a lot of this going, \"Oh, I'm just going to pin it to 300 and that's going to be the wall.\" You're going to have some stuff there. Sure, especially next week, you're going to have those 300s that everyone's going to look like look at on the weekly side. But that's going to pale pale in comparison to where you're at on the open interest rate now on this thing when you go out a little further. And I thought this was absolutely fascinating because if you wanted to know like, hey, where's the where can this get to and then where could it stop? You know, we're all looking at this 295 area, 300 area, 275 like myself, and I'm I'm really looking at the 275 as well, but I think if you break 275, it's on and it's going to get ugly fast. And I think you're heading to this 245. I think that's what could happen. So, I I would watch 275. This doesn't look like it's going to end anytime soon, but there's there's actually more going on in here, and I'd appreciate your feedback on this. If it's too indepth, let me know. Some people are going to glaze over on this, I think, because they're not going to either understand it or care about it. But I I think it's fascinating and I think it's worth going over because I think there's actually understanding the stuff. I think so what I've done is I've just screenshotted from 200 to 275 on calls are over here and then over here you're going to have your and they're the symbols you're going to have for calls and puts and you're just going to have to deal with it. But what what we're focused on here and what I think is important are a couple open interest. Here's your ask. Here's your VA IV and your strike. Same over here but calls over here. But what you're looking for open interest versus volume. In other words, we can get into the IVs and all that, whatever. But what you're really focused on is when are they putting open interest on? What are they really keeping? And I thought that this was because you break it down by percentages. Meaning the people that put this trade on, are they staying with it? Are they not staying with it? For example, if you look at the 250s here, the people that put that on, we don't need the IV, but the people that put that on, they they traded 30,000 contracts, but they left 13,000 on. This is what you're really looking for. So like when you're trading 260, they left half of those on. So here we left, you know, a third on. Here we left half on. And so it's telling you a little bit of a story like what were they trading and then how much are they really leaving on? Like the 270s. You would think that people would be like, \"All right, well it's a $4 option. Do I really want to leave that on?\" You know, versus like the spec stuff, which they tend to leave on a little bit more, right? You'll see the stupid stuff like 79 cents and here's open interest and then all of a sudden that open interest, right? Versus the V. You get it? So um but 275 here like all right. So we're going to leave that on. What I thought was really interesting on a percentage basis around this 260, they're holding 50% of those. And that's yeah, you could say it's a cheap option. You could say here like, all right, that's a that's kind of a cheap option. If you went and looked at the other side of this, when we get into the the ones that are closer on the call side, it's a little bit it's a little bit skewed. It's a little bit different. And the numbers actually show that. What I what I just thought was really fascinating about this is the way on the open interest versus the percentages that you're holding. Also, you can kind of get a little bit into sediment here. And I'm going to just get a little I guess a little esoteric, but if you look at like the 275, the person that's trading the open interest or has these is saying, \"Okay, I'm going to stay with this at 275.\" So, when you see this like the I paid 25 for these. I I'm going to keep them. All right. So, that guy's in. So, this guy's made a decision to hold those 275s. All right. So, you know that that 275 level like when you see the open interest in the volume and you look at it from this perspective on and what you're doing is you're just taking the percentages, right? Like you would know that despite we're going to eyeball it and say that's 90%. You would know that that person's probably not going away at least yet, right? We don't know their full trade. If they're hedging a short, whatever, they might not be going away. So we would look at this and go, \"Okay, well 275 is still going to be an area of interest.\" But the put people here, the people on the put side, they they have kind of a little bit of a weaker hand here. So then you get into this and go, \"All right, well, how about some of this stuff?\" And then you're like, \"Well, the 265 people, they're still there. That the 270s, like they panicked and said, I'm I'm not holding these.\" and you're kind of telling yourself a story. 250 is going to be a really interesting level if we get there. I don't know why it broke up, but 250 is going to be an interesting level. There's there's more here. Now, for time sake, what we're going to do is just circle the ones that I think are important. You remember where the open interest and the the V is. And just for point of reference here, here's the open interest and here's the volume. And of course, same thing over here where you're going to have the open interest and the volume. Cut off the IV here. I just want to go through a couple more of these because I think it's important. So, if you go and take a look at this 300 level and you would say, \"Okay, well, I traded 44,533 contracts here. I kept 8,900. I traded 43 here and I kept 13. Who's holding more?\" And I think that this is really kind of important to look at. It's pretty skewed to the downside that people are still holding that. You say, \"Well, they're in the money.\" Yeah, they're they're in the money. Okay, you could look at it that way. But at that level, these people started giving up. And you're seeing that kind of everywhere a little bit. So like here's your open interest on those what 305s, here's your volume. Like the people that traded those 305s by the end of the day, they're like, \"Yeah, we've had enough.\" And if you would look at that, you would say that you held 10% of those. But then if you go and say, \"Well, the stock closed at 295.\" All right. So what about those 290s that are out? What did those people think? All right. Well, you know that they're roughly the same, are they? I would say that that's 2x what happened here. So, the way that I look at this and and you can spend as much time as you want with this data, but to bring this home, you don't have enough fear in this name yet in my opinion and the the put wall that everyone's looking at. I think you have to start looking at that 275. But if that 275 breaks, where I'm going with all this is you're going to 245 and you're going to go there pretty fast between 275. If it breaks between that and 245, if you like this level of detail, you need to comment. I I like doing this kind of stuff, but we, you know, when you start going down the rabbit hole, I just want to know how much people like this level of detail or if they're like, \"Okay, I'm not following.\" Um, let me know. From a purely technical standpoint, I use a 12, a 22, a 55. You should use what you're comfortable with. We're just going to drop this 200 right here. And we're just going to talk about this. You crack and you can't get over it. Now, I I do think it's important just to note that. And if I just go right here very quickly, you can see all the numbers right there. So you're at 305 on that and you're rejecting that 200 pretty hard and you're wedged in here between these above that you have a 1222 cross that's coming and if you look at these numbers again up here what you can do with them is just move them across and you can see how close they are and then how long it's going to take for those numbers to actually cross. You can it's you can do it linearly. It's obviously not linear but it gives you an understanding of when that's going to happen. I it's not great. Now, if you broke this down, I think you have to at a minimum retest this. I just don't see how you're not going to at this point, especially after this move. If you have a a just a chart that looks like this, you really didn't give anything back. It's not like you bounced and everyone said, \"Okay, everything's fine.\" So, if we measure that bar and just look at the 50% line, I couldn't even get over that 50%. It makes your life super easy when you're looking at this to understand that, oh, if I flip the 305, I'm good. Or I think it's like 30550. I'm good. Just remember up there is the 200 day moving average. And so then you're going to be dealing with that little suck salad. And then all the people that are in this thing that need to get out of it still, right? And you can always just look at them just by hitting volume profile on that, saying, \"Okay, well, where is everybody?\" And it'll kind of tell you where all those players are. And then you look right here again at that point of control. and that point of control on that bar. It's telling you what's going on. I mean, we can actually drop the four at this point. You can just see it like pretty crystal clear what point of control is. Then you got nothing up here. So maybe you can get up there quickly. Maybe, you know, but you you have a lot of work to do here. Um and then if you're going to hold these levels, you would think that you have a shot at holding in here off of that, you know, we're just going off that one bar when I dropped this volume profile. But I I don't know, man. I I got to tell you, I think that you have to retest that low at this point. I I just think that you do. I think that you you're not seeing this kumbaya love fest. Um and I haven't seen it so far. I'm recording this Saturday morning. I haven't seen it yet. If you start looking at the 284 level, you would think that at a minimum you gap fill and then you start thinking like, can you retest that level, that 272 level, you never really had any wicks there. You always had those wicks at the 275, which kind of makes me think that maybe you maybe you have a shot at holding that. If you look at a 4hour chart here, which I tend to do, and then you spend an RS, look at the RSI, and I'm spend a lot of time on this stock because I think there's a lot of money. You can if you can figure it out, like if we could actually figure out where it's going to bounce, because it will bounce. It's a question in the function of where. Um, and to me, it's it's lower at this point. I I don't know the the the reason to buy this, especially when they just lost their their, you know, or reason that I have to step in front of this. I think it was their head of robotics that just resigned. Um, a lot of people are not going to want to deal with this turmoil. they they don't they just want to work and not be bothered. Um and you know you're going to get people that are not going to want to be associated with it. So it's going to happen. Um I tend to see that when you're down at this level on the RSI and we look at it and say, \"Okay, well that's an area of interest because now you're oversold.\" Yes. How many times have you gotten to that 4 hour in the past 12 months and only stayed there and bounced off it super hot here? That kind of happened, but then you didn't. You come back and do a little bit of a retest down here for a period of time, but that's where we got liberated. So you might not think of it that way. Then you could say, \"Well, here, yeah. Yeah, but then you still kind of bounced over and then you kind of came back again. Here you spent a lot of time.\" It's it's rare that you're just going to hit it and quit it. You know, it it just is. And so what we're looking for is we're looking for that kind of trough valuation where yeah, maybe we're going to hit it and then we're going to retest that and then from there we could look at getting involved. If I was to break this down in detail and let's just look at it from a perspective of like a five minute chart and we look at at Friday all it seems to me that it did and it was kind of funny because we just fell apart like all at once. It was like okay 1 2 3 dump. Um we actually had puts on this on on Friday and we did well with those. We did better with this trade. Um we had a couple of these. I'll actually show you that trade in a sec here. But the purpose of spending the time on this is to understand where you're at, right? and to look at these levels and go, \"Okay, well, I really need to watch. I' i'd watch this stock like a hawk next week because I think that this is really where the action is.\" I've marked off a couple key levels, and these are the key levels that I would start with. Now, there's a couple other names I think we should really pay attention to. AVGO tends to do this. They tend to mark off the top of the market, and I've gone over this extensively if you watch these videos, but usually the earnings, for whatever reason, tends to mark a top in the NASDAQ. And it could be just because we're done earnings tech season. You've got some other names coming out, but you had really good report and then once again you're just marking off this high as it tends to do on this and you know there's times when it hasn't really done that but usually it does and it kind of just ties directly into the NASDAQ. So I would just be aware of this some things that you might want to look at and you don't have to look at but if I looked at something like the RSI which is just absolutely imploding right here. just the simple things just and I've been in this since in the 80s we've been in this in the community like 188 and we've been playing it for years but since the first breakout your shortterm you kind of broke better one is really off this level and then tied directly into here and that one broke as well it did break the question really becomes am I going to catch or am I not going to catch here I don't need a top to result in carnage a top could just be going sideways. Pay attention to this gap fill. Like if I if I lose the gap fill, then we're down and it starts getting ugly. When I have a cushion, like a big cushion like I have in this trade, you know, I'm up 70 points and, you know, $180 stock. I do give them room because there's times where I've done that and then I can just stay in them for literally years if you catch them, right? You can just leave them alone. You don't have to really do anything if you catch them the right way. I think this is a super important concept that people and I'm going to do more videos on that like how to stay in things like super long term. What people don't realize is I compartmentalize my accounts in the trading and you should probably as you get bigger and bigger and your accounts grow you should do the same. The compartmentalization makes life easier. If you're day trading and I show you a day trade, it's one thing. Long-term is a completely different game. If you look at Nvidia, I think Nvidia is telling you exactly that. It's like, hey, no, it's not going to be as cool as usual. In other words, Nvidia usually melts down if AVGO melts down on earnings. You're not doing that. What you're really doing is you're holding this deepseek level longer than any time you've held since we've gotten deepseat. Remember, all we need are five Nvidia chips, a hamster, and a nice tuna sandwich, and we're good to go. Gasoline, tuna forever. But if you see these areas right in here over over, and then you're you're opening up and you're staying in that area. super important concepts that I think that you should be paying attention to. Super important concepts. Why are we doing this? Why aren't we falling apart? Because usually it does mark that top and that's not what's happening. So, if that's not what's happening, maybe I should just be cognizant of that. It doesn't mean I have to act on it because again, if you look at the socks, the socks looks fairly decent here. We could look at this again with the RSI and go, well, we we need to turn up a little bit. Sure. Okay, let's go look at the weekly. Does that look bad or does that look like it's just an outright breakout? Well, now we have a new weekly high close on the socks. And I think there's more to this when you start looking at how the, you know, the RSI on the weekly's up. And if you have the socks on the NASDAQ, you're good. But if you go to ASOCS right on the week when this started coming out and this is just when you start looking at AI semiconductors and I do something simple and I do these relative things all the time where I look at ASOC versus ESOX which ASOC is going to be the AI socks and ESOs is going to be the equity and I can leave it in in candlestick form for time sake but usually what I'll do with these is I get rid of the candlesticks. I'll just look at a line and say well what's happening? Okay well this is not rocket science but AI is outperforming everything else that has to do with analog or anything else. So, if I was going to buy anything in semiconductors, which ones would you buy? Well, duh and or hello. I mean, it's pretty obvious, right? But this is telling you that you still have the driver. Like, if this was going flattish, you don't have the driver. It's very It's the same thing when we look at the the spy versus the Q's. You do we have the driver? I would argue that yeah, you do have the driver. You still have this as the driver. You're still hanging into this area where the Q's on the weekly are setting up to break out and outperform the spy, which is what you want. That might be one of the reasons why we're seeing this rotation into RTY because we're setting up for that next leg of the market. And I'm not going to go down that rabbit hole right now, but I will in another video. I mean, remember Atlanta Fed just came out and said we're looking at 39 37 38 GDP. That's growth. That's like massive growth. We still have the whole tariff and the I'm trying not to go down that road right now. I want to stay with names. But when we look at the RTY and I look at the names that in the community that they that were killing it on that still look like they're they're going to go is you take a look at HIMS for example. This was something that we bought again on Friday just gave us a really clear signal to get involved and doing quite well with it. But these names that are hitting these levels they're not falling apart. They're consolidating. And there's a big difference here. There's a big difference between imploding and filling a gap and retesting that gap for two weeks and then building. So when we look at stuff like him, you're not falling apart. You're just building. And that's okay. You know, you got to figure out who you are as a trader. I'm going to do a video on this. I'm going to do more videos on how to build yourself as a trader and an investor. I'm starting to realize that those pieces are missing in these videos from the comments and what people are saying in the community. But this is basing. So if you're a day trader, cool. I got it. But if you're someone like I think Kim could be the next Amazon and there's a part of me that feels that way with this in its particular sector. I have to understand that I'm going to base and that this is going to happen and I have to understand that I want to watch the bars of the red bars get smaller and smaller and look for my hook. Boom. Hook. Got it? So, we're watching these dogeis and this thing's holding in there. But I go through these names like RKLB and some of these others. Now, this whole market opened when Elon and Trump got into their little hissy fight about you're the bad guy. No, you're the bad guy. But like RKLB and all this stuff that's out there, this HWM, all this money that's out there that's going to Starlink and all these different places. I mean, it's not like Trump's petty, right? We know that. So, where does all that money go? Like, is there a Starlink competitor? Can ESTs be that kind of competitor? I don't I mean, I I have a dragonfly at the top of a chart. You know, wicks are what? Say it with me. Price rejection. This thing went from 2264 to 31 in a week. There's a reason why you're seeing the volumes like just start running through the roof on these things. And I think that's very important. In other words, are we going to see rotation? We're going to get into it this week's video. That's why I always say subscribe to this channel and all notifications if you find it important or interesting or you find yourself making money from it. And I appreciate the sharing. I purposely don't run ads on all this stuff on purpose. I know how exhausting that is. I just want to get to it. But if we're looking at this, is this going to be like, oh, you're going to get you're going to have the opportunity for Golden Dome? Why are you seeing where Bezos maybe they're going to invest or maybe they're not going to invest? There's a note on it if you go and take a look at that. But does Bezos want the money that might be going to Starlink that's not going to go there anymore? Could this be an alternative to Starlink? You're gonna have to start connecting the dots. But there's but the themes behind all this are well what's starting to move IWM starting to move. You know more people reached out this week and were asking about regional banks. Well percentage of IWM is regional banks 15.9%. Okay. So if regional banks are going to go, do we start looking at the regional banks again? I don't know. Does that look like something you might want to look at? If you start looking at bank like I I don't know. It sure looks like a cup and handle to me. I mean, here's your, you know, I'm a little teapot, short and stout, and then it goes. So, when you start connecting these dots, are is this what we should be focused on? Or, you know, am I or should I be trading Nvidia over and over again in this three-point range like that car from Austin Powers backing up over and over again in the same spot? I have I have to re rethink some of what I'm doing. And that's the purpose of this segment of the video is like I have to really rethink like, hey, should I start be looking at the IWM? And if I am looking at IWM, what does that tell us about the cycle that we're in? And what I tend to do is I start looking at the names that are really working like what are we really like when we go through this stuff like what are we really making our money off of and where is that money going? You know, it's these names like NBIS all of a sudden that are breaking out and you have this huge volume spike and you know like hey why is Nvidia investing in this company? This is really like I do very well with the themes cuz that's how I was trained with through themes and there's one two other sectors or one thing I do want to get through to people because I want to tie it all together to something else. But the themes are really where I made the money and that was like it's that AI theme. So when I start to see these themes shift, I need to be super cognizant of that. And I think we're shifting into that part of the stool right now where we're going to get the story stuck. In other words, you have your macro and you have your fundamental. And now like over the weekend, we all know ju you know, June 9th, we have this meeting of the minds in London when they're bringing Lutnik. And you know, just FYI, like that's not, you know, he hasn't been the calmst person. He's very different than the other three guys or the other two people that are taking advantage of that or in those meetings, I should say. But we have the macro side of this, right? And we have the technical side of this. But you're getting into the story stock again phase. And the story stock phase is like what we saw early on in 01 with like PLTR if we go back to it. It's becoming the story stock phase. And I think that that's a really exciting phase where you can trade a lot and do very very well. And I don't think it's going to be the same names. I do want to point this out for those people that are watching this. Uh this is a classy example of reflexivity because I keep get asked to point them out. Everybody on their sister thinks Hood's going to get added. So everybody's doing what? They're all out there and they're all buying hood. And then this gets into when we discussed the reflexivity stuff and I'm going to do a short video on this. I have it somewhere that I've been working on it. But everybody's buying this, right? So what do you have here is you have the outcome. Oh, this is the outcome. We're going to go to the moon. We're definitely going to go to the moon because Bank America said that they're going to be added. They're definitely going to be added. And that's why everybody on Friday had to get in this thing. And then you see at the end of the night that the S&P didn't add anybody. So, what you have here are a couple things cuz I got asked by some people in the room, why are we buying or why did I buy puts and put it out as an alert on hood? The reason I bought puts on hood was the it was so skewed to this being the outcome. The expectations were here for the outcome that if the outcome was here, it was so skewed that you were going to make money, right? And that's always the point of doing all this is to make money. That's a classic example in 30 seconds of reflexivity and why we bought the 75 puts and we'll do well on Monday morning.",
