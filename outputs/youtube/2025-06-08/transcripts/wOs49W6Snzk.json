  "transcript": "Good morning everyone. This is daily trading analysis with the weekly recap of this week which has been better than I expected. We are still in range in balance below 4% of all-time highs despite the bad news for the inflationary pressures for the tensions between China and US coming from also bad tensions of Elon Musk and Trump fighting in social media. We had even worse economic data this week. So there's a lot of things going on and the market is still trying to go higher. It's quite surprising how investors and big money is still pouring in sustaining this move. So let's analyze why is this happening. First we are going to review the economic data. On one hand, as I said, there are encouraging signs from the US China trade front. We had our issues with the with the communications with the conversations between both governments. But now today, yesterday afternoon, it was announced that there's a planned meeting in London with US and China trying to have a deal for rare earth export licenses to US automakers. That is going to be super interesting because right now there's a carve in these exports and which is affecting really really badly all these automakers in the US. Additionally, as I said, these economic data are quite encouraging. The recent US labor market data presented a mixed picture. We got US non-farm payrolls that came in at 139,000 which is basically less than expected, less than the previous one, but more than expected. It's one of the few stronger than expected job creations that support economic growth. But on the other hand, we have mixed employment data that makes the future super uncertain. Initial jobless claims came in at 247,000 higher than expected, which is positive to counterbalance this increase in wage pressures. But as you can see there's a lot of negativity, a lot of negative data coming in. We have average earnings which are higher than expected wage growth. We have services price paid at 68.7 sustained price pressures. We have services also on the PMI below contraction which is neutral but services in the S&P is still a 53 which is showing stronger services activity resilient demand. People are still paying these prices. Then we had jolts coming in higher than expected. So basically we had this unexpected rise in job openings, in jobless claims, in services price paid. There's, excuse me, a lot of bad news coming in. But there's persistent inflationary pressures also coming in from the Federal Reserve. We got our decent news on the economic front most probably from the NFP job creation. But this is counterbalanced by the cautious stand from the Federal Reserve. A average hour earnings in the US rose 3% 3.9% as we can see up here year-over-year matching the previous reading. Similarly on a one month overmonth basis the wage growth also surprise to the upside. All these factors are without doubt giving the Fed the pause signal. And that's why more and more we are going to see on the charts that investors and analysts are pricing in less and less probability of rate cuts this year. The economy is strong and that's really bad for inflation. Several Fed officials have recently expressed concerns about inflation risks and uncertainty stemming from most mostly on trade policies. Goldsby suggested that the recent PC inflation that we got last week may have deemed the last vestigial pre- tariff impact and future inflation readings could be even higher. There's a lot of cautious commentary from the Fed and this is certainly impacting the sentiment. Even though Trump is requesting again 100 basis points, one full percentage of rate cuts. Wow. So we have all these in the economic front. In terms of earnings, we got Brocom and AVGO with positive earnings. This is linked with the AI semiconductor sector. So this is pushing AI again higher. So let's move into the charts to see how is this all affecting the markets and the sentiment. And as you can see down here we have the volume on the left side on the left side and the advanced decliners on the right side. This is for the ES. As you can see, we got pretty bullish inflows on Tuesday and Friday. And these are not light. These are pretty heavy 300 million on the volume. The advanced decliners were mostly positive on the higher end. So, the ES is is really pushing higher. ES it's only 3.80% from alltime highs and as you can see this Friday was really really pushing prices higher. Then if we move to the cues we can see similar trend and look at these advanced decliners on the on the f on Friday. This was really good. So big money it's still entering the market and we cannot ignore this in terms of internals. In terms of market internals, things are looking quite bullish, right? And we have on the daily chart, we are in the middle of an inverse fair value gap which we touched one time, two times, three times and we closed higher of the consequent encroachment. We are at 4% of alltime highs. We are so near that I wouldn't be surprised if we continue grinding in. But what I expect it's to get rid of all these people and do this and then this. That would be the typical Wall Street move to reach all-time highs after a manipulation move to the lows to get rid of all these longs and then push higher with a good catalyst to all-time highs. That would be insane. What is true is that the market is stronger than I expected and we have to recognize that in terms of one hour we got our Thursday of pullback but I mean the market is super volatile it's still grinding in as I said we got our really bad move but then we bounced from this one hour and we are pushing higher, getting rid of this buy side liquidity and still pushing higher. So who is doing this? Well, Tesla is trying to sustain to live to this storm of Trump versus Musk. But I mean, it's it's it's still there. Amazon 2.72% Wow. Consumer discretionary XLY was 130 on on Friday. So, this is looking pretty good. It's still sustained. Who else? Google. AI. Nvidia. AI. Look at Nvidia. Nvidia is just saying I don't care. Nvidia is pushing this market. AI sustaining this market. Meta 1.91. Look at this. Apple 1.64. Apple is not looking super good in terms of daily, but long-term Apple has a lot of range for investors. Microsoft alltime highs. So this is these are the companies that are sustaining the ENQ. What else? We have S RSP minimizing mitigating a little bit of momentum. But things that I always like to see, look at the trend. The trend is being established on the 50-day moving average. 68% of 73% more than 70% of stocks are above the 50. This looks really bullish. In terms of the 200 only 43. So we have range for investors to come in if they find it with a good catalyst for them to be confident. There's a lot of growth to be made. And as I said, yields are looking pretty bad. The July one, it's pushing higher. It's at 4.13. This is one rate cut. And in terms of the rest of the year, we can see for sure Let me check December. So if we check December and we calculate the inverse, we can see 3.93. But it's still pushing higher. 3.93 means the second cut in December. This is what they are expecting, what the bonds market is pricing in. UK, it's also near all-time highs. Russell it's in the middle but there's a lot of growth to be made. So there's in terms of look at financials all in the green financials are looking strong everything it's it's near all-time highs why is this happening when we have so many issues in the US that's a question for you but what I would do it's the following we are more and more seeing bullish signals in in this market. But don't get me wrong, the fundamentals are still quite uncertain. If you are a big investor, you are waiting for the final pullback to go all in for all-time highs. That's what I will do. And certainly this I've seen that in the past. I've seen that in the past. We saw that in here with this manipulation move and then grind higher. Wall Street wants to get rid of all their competition. If there are longs right now, they will not push all-time highs unless there's a big catalyst, of course. But if we are grinding like this, I wouldn't be surprised if they manipulate to the downside and then go straight to all-time highs when they find the best catalyst. So why I'm saying this is because be careful with the volatility. Be careful with what you expect. Expect the unexpected always. And my best recommendation is for you to be smart, be disciplined, be patient for that move in which you think, okay, this is the move. Despite the fact that this looks good, this is not the way we should go to all-time highs. A slow grind of shorts. I don't know. I would like this kind of move. This this then a little bit of pullback and then pushing higher. So, what I would like the NASDAQ to do is to pull back a bit. most I would like to revisit this daily bullish fury gap and then manipulate do a second one and then go straight to alltime highs to 23,000. So we will see what happens. There's a lot of things going on and we have to slowly but surely go through all the issues. Trump is mask, China, US, inflationary pressures, trade policies, all these. But AI is looking strong. And that's all from my side. As always, thank you for your time.
