  "transcript": "Hello and welcome to Ask You for a Trend. I'm Josh Lipton and for the next half hour, we are breaking down the trends of today that'll move stocks tomorrow. There's a lot to keep track of, so we're focusing on what you need to know to get ahead of the curve. Here are some of the trends we're going to be diving into. Stocks jumped today, rallying for the last trading day of the week. Investors like the positive jobs data they heard this morning. And all major indices did end the day up with the S&P back above 6,000 today. And as excitement around Apple baked, the tech giant is getting ready for its big developer event next week. We're looking at what it may take to reignite investor sentiment around Apple stock. And Americans paying student or car loans will want to know what to expect when it comes to their debt and their wallets. This year we're taking consumer credit check. You won't want to miss that. Well, turning to well-known tech stocks now. Apple and Tesla have both had moments as investor favorites, flagships of innovation and growth, but what would it take to reignite investor confidence in those days? We're talking with our next guest about this and much more. Welcome Patrick Morehead, founder and CEO at More Insights and Strategy. Patrick, it is great to have you on the show. Let's talk Apple here, Patrick, because they got their big software show that kicks off of course on Monday. Uh, the stock is down, Patrick, about 20% this year. The Journal reminding us that is the worst run the shares have experienced ahead of the company's WWDC event since at least they say 2010. What explains that, Patrick? And what does Apple need to do to turn this around? Yeah, it's been a bad year for Apple and some of it has been caused by Apple and some of it has been caused by the market. Uh the first thing is AI. Uh Apple telegraphed a year ago that it would bring AI to the masses and it missed its schedules, had to pull its advertising and it was pretty much a a disaster on on all fronts. And then you had China which a lot of things going on in China. The first is they're losing market share in China as brands like Huawei become more competitive and there's a sense of nationalism of we should buy Chinese phones by the by by the Chinese. And then of course you have tariffs where most of Apple's iPhones historically had been made in China. I give them credit for moving 60% of the final assembly over to India by the end of the year. but it's a little uh it's too little too late for them. So, it's really multiple issues that's been uh dragging on the stocks. And quite frankly, Josh, uh what is exciting investors is AI and AI growth in the data center and Apple is all not that. They are AI on the device uh at best. On AI, Patrick, here's what I hear. I I hear some Apple bulls make the following argument. And I'm very curious to get your take. They say, \"Yeah, Apple is playing a different game.\" In other words, they'll argue Apple is not spending billions and billions and billions of dollars on AI capex. That is the meta Microsoft Google playbook. Apple will say different strategy. What they're doing is they're going capital light and then charging a fee to model providers who want access to their many many iOS users. and that they're trying to argue, hey, their argument is that is a smarter way to generate a compelling return. What do you make of that argument? So, it's a little bit of a pass the buck argument. I think if Apple had a core competency in the cloud uh beyond uh downloading movies and and backup uh and iTunes uh it it would be a very different story. I I think that uh Apple because it doesn't have the core competency in the cloud is much more focused on making the ondevice experience better and and I give Apple I I I like that strategy for device makers but in reality as we've seen with companies like Samsung they're leveraging uh ondevice AI for themselves uh and then leveraging Google uh for quite frankly the user doesn't care where it comes from. They just want a good experience. Uh that's very that's very quick and they don't want to pay a lot for it. So I think it's a pass the buck type of strategy. What do you make of an argument I've heard and I heard on today's show Patrick from an Apple bull who will say listen it comes down the install base. They've got a lot of loyal fans all over the world. I think you know close to 2.4 billion active devices. It's a number it's hard to even get your head around. And their point is, hey, that's a lot of loyal locked in fans. That buys Apple not just months, but they'll tell me years in their opinion to get AI right. Yeah, Josh, it they're absolutely correct. Apple has some of the most loyal customers out there. And we can debate whether loyalty is really just because they don't open up iMessage and they don't want to be the green chat along with the blue chat folks and be looked at as you know what's what's wrong with you. But but they do have loyalty and smartphones have as in in essence have become a commodity and the the equation that goes through somebody's head if they want to switch is really about my gosh this is going to be huge hassle. It's like changing a bank, right? What a hassle uh to be able to do that. So 100% there's a lot of stickiness. And I like to say that brands have halflife. Okay? And I I think Apple can continue to not deliver on AI and not do a tremendous amount of damage to their brand in the United States and Western Europe. But when it comes to Southeast Asia and China and Japan and South America, uh it it is becoming an issue here and the longer that they're looked at as as uncompetitive. Patrick, another theme I I got to get your take on because we were all watching it play out in real time. Trump and Musk, the bromance, the breakup. Patrick, what what did you make of what you were watching on social media unfold? And in your opinion, are there are there broader implications, broader lessons learned for CEOs and maybe tech CEOs in particular from all that? Yeah. So, first of all, it was ugly and it was very very personal and it shook the Tesla stock. Uh, which I'm scratching my head a little bit on that one, but I do have opinions. But I I think it's it's important and I do think most publicly traded tech companies have kind of had an armslength relationship uh with the administration and they didn't get they got close but they didn't get get too close like the contingent of companies that went over to the uh middle middle east and cut these major deals. you want to be part of that as a tech CEO. If there's a giant tech round table where they're discussing something like regulation or privacy, you want to be part of that. You want to be looked I wouldn't say it's pro-administration, but at a minimum neutral. You can no longer sit on the sidelines as a tech CEO and not go to the White House, pay homage, and maybe even kiss the ring at the White House or down in Mara Lago. Patrick, we're always lucky to have you on the show. Thank you, sir. Josh, thanks. Stick around. Much more. Ask for a trend still to come. US stocks closing higher as the S&P 500 hits the 6,000 mark, its highest level since February. The finest is Jared Blickery joining us now with the trading day takeaways. Jared, thank you Josh. I'm going to call this a jobs day win because we are higher on the day. We are higher on the week and it didn't have to go that way. The jobs report was not great. Here's the S&P 500 up 1%. Just quickly, I'm going to show you this is a year-to- date chart. That's what I wanted to show. So, just barely eatking out a new high. And by the way, these are the record highs in February. Not that much higher here. So, just a short distance to go. We did see the VIX coming down with a 16 handle. Look at that. Uh, also at a four-month low, I believe. And then the 10-year Treasury note was climbing. So, it's above 4 and a.5%. 30-year approaching 5% again. But all in all, a pretty good report. And I had a chance to discuss AI. And we're talking about jobs, all the tech jobs. We lost nearly 60,000 this year alone, 150,000 last year. I talked about this with Shervid Mashayeki. Um, and he, this is on a sit stocks and translation episode. Here's what he had to say about the whole thing. Then you have the emergence of AI and it's not again yet displacing people in like kind of a direct way, but what is doing is it's telling people, do I want to invest in workforce? Do I want headcount that might be here for the next 3 to 5 to 10 years? Do I want to invest in a management layer that has expectations? If I believe that AI is coming in a way, and we're starting to see this augmentation where engineers, as an example, can produce a lot more code if they're using some of these tools, you don't want to in 2025 invest in a big junior or mid-level engineering class because you'll have those people in two to three years. So, the big takeaway for me is it's not people necessarily getting canned, although that's happening. It's we're not investing in younger people for the future because we don't know what's going to happen. Another big theme this week, Trump, Musk romance, breakup. Yes. What do you make of it? Well, I'm going to hit it tangentially because I think we've spilt enough ink on this and video pixels. BA, they had a brilliant chart out today. The bro billionaires versus a base. Let me just bring it up right now. In the green, we have the Russell 2000. I guess that's the Trump base here. And then in the white we have this equal weighted index of Nvidia, Meta, Palanteer, Tesla, Interactive Brokers, Bitcoin, Arc Innovation Fund, Coinbase, and Apollo Global Management, which is our parent company, but a proxy for PE. And you can see that it is still elevated though off of the highs here. And this just kind of illustrates the vicissitudes, let's call it that way, the vicissitudes of the Trump administration, things reacting to tariff policy in various ways. here. Another trend I know you're thinking studying the theme whether prepandemic themes making a comeback. Yeah, I'll tell you what. NERP, the revenge of the NERP. That would be negative interest rate policy. We never had it in the US. We had ZERP, which is zero interest rate policy. We had that for about a decade or so. But NERP is something that was experienced in Switzerland. And guess what? It is back. Also in Japan, but not there. Japan's actually going up pretty quickly. But in Swiss, we got this Alpine cold bath on yields. And my take on that is it might actually be good for the US. And next week, we got these big auctions on desk. We got the three, the 10, and the 30-year on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday. And we need those indirect bids. We need foreigners bidding on our on our markets. Otherwise, if we don't get that, stocks could take a tumble. We've seen some of those dynamics play out over the last few weeks. So, I think it could actually be a positive for the US, but I'm not excited to be to see uh NERP making a comeback in general. What did Shakespeare have to say about negative rates? Uh, no. Neither a lender nor borrower be I guess unless you're a debtor and you're getting paid for it. It's a classy way to end the segment. Thank you. Pelonius is spinning in his shallow Danish grave. Sophisticated. Thank you, Jared. Thank you. Stick around. Much more Ash for a trend. That's still to come. We're checking in on the consumer. New data from Vantage Score shows student loans dragging on delinquency rates. Auto loans surging past prepandemic highs. For more, we're bringing in now Silio Tavvaris, CEO and president of Vantage Score. Silio, always great to see you, especially on set. So, we are always looking as investors for lines of signing the consumer. Silio, different data, different metrics. What maybe start big picture. What are you seeing? What do you see with the consumer based on the credit data you have for uh April? What we saw is consumers um turning from a more cautious standpoint to being actually net borrowers increasing their consumption of credit which was unexpected. And basically what we're seeing uh is consumers moving from standing on the sidelines to actually increasing their credit utilization especially in auto loans to get ahead of that tariff pricing that they expect later in the year. So broadly um resilient do you expect them to stay resilient? What what and what would be the the variable variables Silia that would depend on? Well resilient is a really good way to uh describe the consumer right now. What we're seeing is average credit balances really staying about the same somewhat of an increase but not excessive. We're also seeing delinquencies really moderate. um there is an increase on a year-over-year basis, but if you look on a historical basis, they're quite resilient. In fact, uh when you look at the highest quality uh consumers in terms of the credit score, we call that Vantage score super prime. Vantage score 780 and above, we actually saw that percentage of total consumers increase in the month of April. So overall, resilient, high quality credit and at the same time, consumers are willing to use credit to get ahead of the tariff uh price increases they expect. So overall resilient what are the risks you would have on your radar soil? Well normally if you see an increase in credit utilization but at the same time an a worsening of the employment um environment that's when you get concerned but we didn't see that through April. Um the employment numbers that came out this week including yesterday and this morning they show that overall employment is is steady. Um and so that's another sign that actually consumers are quite credit healthy. Now looking forward, if we see the employment picture weakening and at the same time an increase in credit utilization, then it's time to worry because you know that consumers are losing their jobs at the same time charging up their credit cards. That's a bad sign for the economy. What about auto loans? What's the latest data there, Sio? Well, auto loans in April, um we reported this two weeks ago before today's um US Commerce Department report came out. Auto loans surged in April. Um, and in some ways you could you could foresee that, right? Uh, consumers are looking at the year and they're saying, \"Well, my car is about to give out and and I see tariffs coming at 50 100%. I better get ahead of it.\" And so, we saw a significant surge. In fact, borrowing for uh for auto loans was higher than pre- pandemic. We haven't seen this rate of growth since uh January 2020. What about the resumption of student loan payments? Talk to me about that dynamic and ripple effects. Yeah, student loan reporting started uh in earnest after uh more than a two-year hiatus. It actually started again in earnest in late January and February. And we saw our average Vantage score actually drop by a full percentage point in um in February. It's since rebounded and that was a really healthy move because what we saw is consumers seeing that new data being reported and immediately reacting to it looking to uh make their payments on time get back up to date on their student loans and as a result we've seen that average Vantage score come back to 702 and it's stayed at that level since then. That shows a consumer that has a little room on their balance sheet and can get back on track in terms of their student loans. Uh finally, I'm going to touch on the Fed. uh their decision to stand pat Silvio, what does that mean for consumers looking ahead? Well, for now, what it means is consumers are going to continue to have relatively elevated interest payments. Um, if you look at sort of the the the the long-term um interest rates are relatively high compared to what we've seen previously. And so with the interest rates staying where they are, it means all other things being equal, fewer consumers taking out new mortgages, fewer consumers maxing out their credit cards, in general, a lower level of credit utilization. I know you're a longtime Fed watcher. What do you make of their decision, Stan, Pat? Well, I think they're concerned about um what the in impact could be of increased pricing um from organically the economy, but but also um some sometimes related to tariffs and they're unclear about how that's going to impact the economy. It could be inflationary and they want to wait and see those results coming through before they make any sudden movements. The reality is if you look at fundamentally the economy and overall credit health, it's pretty stable and you don't want to mess up a good thing. Pretty stable. A positive note. Let's go into the weekend with that. So, thank you, sir. It's always great to see you. Great to see you, Josh. Looking at it next week. It's a packed calendar of earnings reports. We're watching GameStop, Oracle, and Adobe. Going to start with GameStop here. Set to release its first quarter earnings after market hours on Tuesday. Analysts expecting a decrease in revenue is estimating a 16% decrease from the prior year. The video game retailer is undergoing a change to focus on e-commerce, but industry shifts and digital disruptions could spellill caution for investors. Next up, Oracle, which announces fourth quarter earnings aftermarket hours on Wednesday. Tech companies estimated to report 15.58 billion in revenue driven primarily by their emphasis on AI and cloud platforms. After its positive third quarter earnings, Oracle's performance for fiscal 25 looks strong and next Wednesday will be the test. And finally, Adobe sharing Q2 earnings on Thursday, also aftermarket hours. Analyst expecting consensus to be met for the company the second quarter with revenue estimated at 5.8 billion. Previously, quarterly earnings for the company causing share prices to drop in the day following driven by disappointment in earnings. Well, that is a wrap on today's Ask for Trend.
